## How to Use This File

### Before Every Run
1. Read this entire file
2. Check **Known Issues** for active problems to avoid
3. Check **Repeat Errors** — if you hit the same issue again, flag it to the user immediately
4. Apply all lessons to your execution plan

### After Every Run
1. Add a new entry under **Run Log** using the template below
2. If something went wrong, add it to **Known Issues**
3. If a Known Issue happened again, move it to **Repeat Errors** and increment the count
4. If you solved a Known Issue, move it to **Resolved Issues**
