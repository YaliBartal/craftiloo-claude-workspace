# PPC Portfolio Review: 4 Flowers Embroidery

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Data Window:** Last 7 days (excl. last 2 days)
**Portfolio Stage:** Launch (early — most campaigns started Jan 2026, 23 orders/week, structure still being built)
**Monthly Budget Cap:** $6,000

## Portfolio Overview

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Total Spend | $415.98 | — | — |
| Total Sales | $556.55 | — | — |
| Portfolio ACoS | 74.74% | Flexible (CVR focus at Launch) | Well Above — but stage context applies |
| Portfolio ROAS | 1.34 | — | — |
| Total Orders | 23 | — | — |
| Portfolio CVR | 4.14% (23/556) | 10% | Below Target |
| Active Campaigns | 14 (+ 1 dormant) | — | — |

**Stage Note:** At Launch stage, ACoS thresholds are flexible. CVR is the PRIMARY metric. Portfolio CVR of 4.14% is well below the 10% target — this is the most important issue to address. Several campaigns have strong CVR individually (see below), but significant spend is bleeding on zero-order campaigns.

---

## Action To-Do List

### P1 — Act Now (Highest Impact)

- [ ] **4 flowers - SD video TOS push**: ACoS 292.82%, 1 order in 52 clicks, running out of budget daily. Pause or significantly lower bids — this is burning spend with near-zero return. Check if video creative is relevant before any revival.
- [ ] **4 flowers- shield brand self target**: ACoS 193.03% on 1 order. At $48.22 spend for $24.98 in sales this is deeply negative. Brand shield campaigns should have low spend — this one is oversized. Lower bids significantly.
- [ ] **SO | Embroidery Kit | B0DC69M3YD | SPM | PT | 4 flowers**: ACoS 133.43%, running OUT_OF_BUDGET at $5/day budget while generating poor returns. Either raise budget if targeting is right (verify search terms), or lower bids and fix targeting relevance first.
- [ ] **4 flowers - SPM SK embroidery for beginners TOS**: $54.51 spend, 0 orders, 0 sales in 54 clicks. This is a TOS campaign hemorrhaging money. CVR = 0%. Lower bids significantly or pause to prevent further bleed while diagnosing.
- [ ] **4 flowers - shield brand asins**: $18.84 spend, 0 orders, 0 sales. Brand ASIN shield campaign with no return. Lower bids — this should be low-cost maintenance only.

### P2 — Investigate & Adjust

- [ ] **4 flowers - SPM SK embroidery for beginners TOS** (follow-up): After stopping bleed (P1 above), check search terms report — determine if keywords are irrelevant or if listing has a conversion problem for this keyword set.
- [ ] **4 flowers - SPM SK beginner needlepoint kits for adults TOS**: ACoS 91.23% on 1 order. TOS campaign — check Data Dive for rank movement on "needlepoint kits for adults" before cutting. If no rank movement, lower bids meaningfully.
- [ ] **4 flowers - SPM MK broad ultra targeted**: ACoS 51.2%, 7 orders, CVR 4.79%. High ACoS but at Launch stage with volume — acceptable only if it's harvesting converting search terms. Pull search term report and negative out irrelevant terms. This is your highest-spend campaign.
- [ ] **SO | Embroidery Kit | B0DC69M3YD | SPM | SK | crossstitching kits adult beginner**: $1.28 spend, 0 orders in 7+ months. Near-dead campaign. Either raise bids or consider pausing — not generating enough data to evaluate.
- [ ] **SO | Embroidery Kit | B0BWSGRTB1| SPM | PT | Brand's ASINs**: $8.03 spend, 0 orders. PT campaign targeting brand ASINs — check if ASINs are still active/relevant. Lower bids if they are, or restructure targets.
- [ ] **SO | Embroidery Kit | B0BWSGRTB1 | SPM | CAT | Embroidery Kits**: $2.86 spend, 0 orders, started Mar 2024 — very old with no recent conversion. CAT campaigns should have stricter ACoS thresholds (20-25%). This one is effectively dormant at low spend. Raise bids or restructure.
- [ ] **4 flowers - SPM SK embroidery starter kit beginner TOS**: $13.62 spend, 0 orders, 11 clicks. TOS campaign started Nov 2025 with 3+ months of data — no longer new. Zero orders is a signal. Lower bids or pause and reallocate budget.

### P3 — Monitor / Scale

- [ ] **4 flowers - SPM SK beginners embroidery kit for adults TOS**: ACoS 28.74%, 7 orders, CVR 8.14% — approaching target. Healthy for Launch stage. Monitor — if CVR hits 10%, consider scaling budget.
- [ ] **4 flowers - SPM SK easy embroidery kits for beginners TOS**: ACoS 27.66%, 4 orders, CVR 11.11% — CVR above 10% target. Top performer. Healthy, scaling candidate.
- [ ] **SO | Emroidery Kit | SPM | Defence | Brand KW**: ACoS 1.8%, 1 order from 1 click. Tiny spend but perfect efficiency. Monitor — raise bids slightly to capture more volume.

### Structure Gaps

- [ ] **No Auto (SPA) campaign active**: All SPA campaigns are PAUSED. An active Auto campaign is required per SOP — it harvests new keywords and provides a data baseline. Launch a new SPA campaign for the main ASIN (B0DC69M3YD) immediately.
- [ ] **Video/SB campaigns all PAUSED**: The only active video-type is the "SD video TOS push" (SB2), which is flagged P1. All other SB/SBV campaigns are paused. At Launch stage this is acceptable, but plan to reactivate once SP campaigns are stabilized.

## Campaign-by-Campaign Analysis

### 1. 4 flowers - SPM MK broad ultra targeted — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | MK Broad | — |
| Spend | $84.41 (20.3% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 51.2% | Above flexible Launch target |
| CVR | 4.79% (7/146) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.58 | — |
| CTR | 0.89% | — |
| Orders | 7 | — |
| Sales | $164.87 | — |
| Budget | $12.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~5 weeks (started 1/11/26) | — |

**Assessment:** Highest-spend campaign and top revenue driver at $164.87 in sales. ACoS of 51.2% is high but this campaign is under 8 weeks old — CVR focus applies. The 7 orders signal that targeting is hitting relevant buyers, but 51.2% ACoS means bids may be too aggressive or irrelevant terms are mixed in. At $0.58 CPC this is on the lower end — the issue is likely search term quality, not bid level.

**Recommendation:** Pull search term report — negative out irrelevant or low-CVR terms aggressively. Do not lower bids yet. Allow campaign to mature and let negatives do the work. Reassess in 2 weeks.

### 2. 4 flowers - SPM SK embroidery for beginners TOS — FLAG

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | SK TOS | — |
| Spend | $54.51 (13.1% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (no sales) | No return |
| CVR | 0% (0/54) | Well below 10% |
| CPC | $1.01 | — |
| CTR | 1.14% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $11.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 42.18% | — |
| Age | ~4 weeks (started 1/19/26) | — |

**Assessment:** Second-highest spend, zero return. $54.51 burned with 0 orders. TOS IS of 42.18% means it's successfully achieving top-of-search placement — the impression and click traffic is reaching the listing. The issue is at the listing level (conversion) or the keyword "embroidery for beginners" attracts a different buyer than this product satisfies. At 4 weeks old this is still in new campaign territory but the 0-order signal at this spend level demands action.

**Recommendation:** Lower bids significantly to reduce daily spend while diagnosing. Check listing conversion rate for this keyword. If the product listing converts well for other "beginner" keywords (see campaigns 3 and 7), this specific keyword set may be mismatched. Check Data Dive for rank movement before making final call. Do not pause immediately — gather one more week of data at lower bids.

### 3. 4 flowers - SPM SK beginners embroidery kit for adults TOS — HEALTHY

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | SK TOS | — |
| Spend | $51.11 (12.3% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 28.74% | At/Below target for Launch |
| CVR | 8.14% (7/86) | Approaching 10% |
| CPC | $0.59 | — |
| CTR | 1.48% | — |
| Orders | 7 | — |
| Sales | $177.86 | — |
| Budget | $20.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 8.62% | — |
| Age | ~5 weeks (started 1/11/26) | — |

**Assessment:** Best-performing SK campaign. 7 orders, 28.74% ACoS, CVR approaching 10%. "Beginners embroidery kit for adults" is clearly a converting keyword for this product. TOS IS is low at 8.62% — there is room to push this keyword harder to gain rank. This campaign deserves more budget and higher bid investment.

**Recommendation:** Consider raising bids slightly to push TOS IS higher and build rank on this keyword. Monitor CVR — if it holds above 8%, increase budget. This is a priority keyword for organic rank building.

### 4. 4 flowers - SD video TOS push — FLAG (URGENT)

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Video (SB2) | — |
| Spend | $49.72 (11.9% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 292.82% | Severely above any target |
| CVR | 1.92% (1/52) | Well below 10% |
| CPC | $0.96 | — |
| CTR | 1.06% | — |
| Orders | 1 | — |
| Sales | $16.98 | — |
| Budget | $7.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Viewable Impressions | 903 | — |
| Age | ~3.5 months (started 11/5/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Running OUT_OF_BUDGET daily at $7/day while delivering 292.82% ACoS. This is the worst-performing active campaign by return. At 3.5 months old it is no longer new — the data is clear. 1 order from 52 clicks over the data window with $49.72 spent is deeply negative. Video campaigns can tolerate lower CTR but CVR of 1.92% at this ACoS level is unacceptable.

**Recommendation:** Pause this campaign immediately. The $49.72/week spend is generating $16.98 in sales. Before any revival, evaluate the video creative quality and whether the targeting aligns with buyers. Do not increase budget or raise bids.

### 5. 4 flowers- shield brand self target — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Brand Shield | — |
| Spend | $48.22 (11.6% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 193.03% | Severely above any target |
| CVR | 1.61% (1/62) | Well below 10% |
| CPC | $0.78 | — |
| CTR | 1.66% | — |
| Orders | 1 | — |
| Sales | $24.98 | — |
| Budget | $10.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 10.93% | — |
| Age | ~8.5 months (started 5/30/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Brand shield campaigns are expected to have low spend — this one is running like a full-scale offensive campaign at $48.22/week. The purpose of a brand shield is to defend the brand's own search result page at low cost. At 193% ACoS and only 1 order, the bids are far too high relative to the defensive intent. This is not generating meaningful revenue — it is bleeding budget.

**Recommendation:** Lower bids significantly. Brand shield target spend should be minimal — a few dollars/week at most. Reduce bids until daily spend drops to $1-3/day range.

### 6. SO | Embroidery Kit | B0DC69M3YD | SPM | PT | 4 flowers — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Product Targeting (PAT) | — |
| Spend | $33.33 (8.0% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 133.43% | Well above target |
| CVR | 3.13% (1/32) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $1.04 | — |
| CTR | 1.35% | — |
| Orders | 1 | — |
| Sales | $24.98 | — |
| Budget | $5.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 24.77% | — |
| Age | ~10 months (started 4/10/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Running OUT_OF_BUDGET at only $5/day — this means it's hitting its cap daily, but ACoS is 133%. The $5/day budget is too small to gather meaningful data quickly, but the ACoS at current bids is unsustainable. At 10 months old, this is not a new campaign. The 1 order / 32 clicks CVR suggests targeting may not be well-matched to buyer intent.

**Recommendation:** Lower bids first to bring ACoS under control — do not raise budget with current ACoS. Review ASIN targets: are competitors being targeted relevant to this product? Remove poor-performing targets. Reassess after bids are reduced.

### 7. 4 flowers - SPM SK easy embroidery kits for beginners TOS — TOP PERFORMER

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | SK TOS | — |
| Spend | $26.81 (6.4% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 27.66% | Below target — healthy |
| CVR | 11.11% (4/36) | Above 10% target |
| CPC | $0.74 | — |
| CTR | 1.05% | — |
| Orders | 4 | — |
| Sales | $96.92 | — |
| Budget | $15.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 34.38% | — |
| Age | ~5 weeks (started 1/11/26) | — |

**Assessment:** Top performer. CVR above 10%, ACoS 27.66%, TOS IS 34.38%. "Easy embroidery kits for beginners" is a strong keyword that converts well for this product. This campaign is delivering results at a healthy efficiency. TOS IS at 34% is solid and building rank.

**Recommendation:** Scale this campaign — consider raising bids slightly to push TOS IS above 40%. This is the clearest candidate for increased budget allocation. Monitor that CVR holds above 10% as bids increase.

### 8. 4 flowers - SPM SK beginner needlepoint kits for adults TOS — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | SK TOS | — |
| Spend | $22.79 (5.5% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 91.23% | Well above target |
| CVR | 4.76% (1/21) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $1.09 | — |
| CTR | 2.27% | — |
| Orders | 1 | — |
| Sales | $24.98 | — |
| Budget | $15.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 35.04% | — |
| Age | ~6 weeks (started 1/7/26) | — |

**Assessment:** TOS campaign with high TOS IS (35%) but poor CVR. At 6 weeks old this is borderline on the "needs more data" rule. 1 order from 21 clicks and 91% ACoS is not encouraging, but the CTR of 2.27% is above average — shoppers are clicking. The conversion problem may be at the listing or product-keyword fit level for "needlepoint." Check Data Dive for rank movement before acting.

**Recommendation:** Check Data Dive for organic rank movement on "beginner needlepoint kits for adults." If rank is moving, tolerate the ACoS for another 1-2 weeks. If no rank movement, lower bids meaningfully to reduce spend. Do not pause yet — TOS IS and CTR signal the keyword is being reached.

### 9. 4 flowers - shield brand asins — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Brand Shield (ASIN targeting) | — |
| Spend | $18.84 (4.5% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (no sales) | No return |
| CVR | 0% (0/24) | Well below 10% |
| CPC | $0.79 | — |
| CTR | 2.22% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $7.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~6.5 months (started 7/29/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Brand ASIN shield campaign spending $18.84/week with zero return. Like the brand self-target campaign above, this should be a minimal-cost defensive play — not a significant spend item. At 6.5 months old with 0 orders in this data window, bids are too high relative to the defensive purpose, or the ASIN targets are not converting.

**Recommendation:** Lower bids significantly. Target spend of $1-2/day max for this campaign type. Check that the ASINs being targeted are your own active listings.

### 10. 4 flowers - SPM SK embroidery starter kit beginner TOS — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | SK TOS | — |
| Spend | $13.62 (3.3% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (no sales) | No return |
| CVR | 0% (0/11) | Well below 10% |
| CPC | $1.24 | — |
| CTR | 3.49% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $17.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 30.27% | — |
| Age | ~3 months (started 11/13/25) | — |

**Assessment:** At 3 months old, this campaign is no longer experimental. CTR is strong (3.49%) which means shoppers are clicking — the breakdown is at the listing conversion step. "Embroidery starter kit beginner" may overlap heavily with other campaigns, or this specific keyword has a buyer profile mismatch. 0 orders from 11 clicks in the data window at 3 months is a clear signal.

**Recommendation:** Lower bids to reduce daily spend. Check for keyword overlap with other SK campaigns. If no orders appear within another 2 weeks at reduced bids, pause and reallocate budget to top performers.

### 11. SO | Embroidery Kit | B0BWSGRTB1 | SPM | PT | Brand's ASINs — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Product Targeting (PAT) | — |
| Spend | $8.03 (1.9% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (no sales) | No return |
| CVR | 0% (0/17) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.47 | — |
| CTR | 1.33% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $15.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~10 months (started 4/15/25) | — |

**Assessment:** PT campaign targeting brand ASINs with 0 orders at 10 months old. Spend is relatively low at $8.03/week but with no return this is still wasted budget. At this age it should be converting. The low CPC ($0.47) suggests bids are already low. The issue is likely targeting relevance or ASIN status.

**Recommendation:** Review which ASINs are being targeted — confirm they are active and relevant. If ASINs are correct, consider pausing this campaign and reallocating the small budget to top performers.

### 12. SO | Embroidery Kit | B0BWSGRTB1 | SPM | CAT | Embroidery Kits — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Category Targeting (CAT) | — |
| Spend | $2.86 (0.7% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (no sales) | No return |
| CVR | 0% (0/12) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.24 | — |
| CTR | 1.28% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $35.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~23 months (started 3/31/24) | — |

**Assessment:** Nearly 2 years old, $35/day budget, but spending only $2.86/week — severely under-bidding. Catch-all/CAT campaigns require stricter ACoS targets (20-25%) and this one is generating nothing. The budget is massive but bids must be very low. At this age with no recent conversion data, the campaign structure may be stale.

**Recommendation:** Either raise bids meaningfully to generate volume and test viability, or pause and reallocate the $35/day budget to performing campaigns. Do not leave it as-is at near-zero activity.

### 13. SO | Embroidery Kit | B0DC69M3YD | SPM | SK | crossstitching kits adult beginner — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | SK | — |
| Spend | $1.28 (0.3% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (no sales) | No return |
| CVR | 0% (0/2) | No data |
| CPC | $0.64 | — |
| CTR | 0.80% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $25.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~12 months (started 2/18/25) | — |

**Assessment:** 1 year old, spending only $1.28/week on a $25/day budget — massively under-bidding. 2 clicks is insufficient to evaluate CVR. The campaign is effectively inactive at current bids. "Crossstitching kits adult beginner" may be a lower-volume keyword or bids are far below floor.

**Recommendation:** Flag as under-bidding. Either raise bids significantly to generate enough data to evaluate, or pause this campaign. Cannot make a quality decision on 2 clicks.

### 14. SO | Emroidery Kit | SPM | Defence | Brand KW — TOP PERFORMER (tiny scale)

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Brand Defense / SK | — |
| Spend | $0.45 (0.1% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 1.8% | Excellent |
| CVR | 100% (1/1) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $0.45 | — |
| CTR | 0.57% | — |
| Orders | 1 | — |
| Sales | $24.98 | — |
| Budget | $30.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~7 months (started 7/15/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Minuscule spend but perfect efficiency: $0.45 spend generated $24.98 in sales (1.8% ACoS). Brand KW defense is working at near-zero cost. The 1/1 CVR is a single data point — not statistically significant — but the concept is sound. Like the CAT campaign above, this is severely under-bidding against a $30/day budget.

**Recommendation:** Raise bids slightly to capture more brand keyword traffic. This is the most efficient campaign in the portfolio. Even modest bid increases here could generate outsized returns. Monitor CVR as volume increases.

## Dormant Campaigns (ENABLED but no activity)

| Campaign | Budget | Start Date | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|------------|----------------|
| SO \| Embroidery Kit \| B0C5S1FW5L\| SPM \| CAT \| Embroidery Kits | $10.00/day | 4/1/24 | Nearly 2 years old with zero recent activity. Check if ASIN B0C5S1FW5L is still active. If inactive ASIN — pause this campaign immediately. If ASIN is active — investigate bids, they appear to be at or near zero. |

---

## Structure Check

| Required Type | Present? | Campaign | Status |
|--------------|----------|----------|--------|
| Auto (SPA) | **No** | Missing — all SPA campaigns are PAUSED | **Critical Gap** |
| Broad | Yes | 4 flowers - SPM MK broad ultra targeted | Active, highest spend — needs search term negatives |
| Product Targeting (PAT) | Yes | SO \| Embroidery Kit \| B0DC69M3YD \| SPM \| PT \| 4 flowers | Active but poor ACoS, needs bid adjustment |
| Single Keyword (SK) | Yes | Multiple SK campaigns present | Active — several performing |
| TOS Push | Yes | Multiple SK campaigns are TOS-oriented | Active |
| Brand Shield | Yes | 4 flowers - shield brand self target + shield brand asins | Overspending — bids need reduction |
| Video (SB/SBV) | Partial | 4 flowers - SD video TOS push (SB2) — all others PAUSED | Active one is flagged P1 for pause |
| Category Targeting (CAT) | Yes | SO \| Embroidery Kit \| B0BWSGRTB1 \| SPM \| CAT \| Embroidery Kits | Active but near-zero spend — under-bidding |

**Gaps:**

- **Auto (SPA) — Critical:** No active Auto campaign exists. This is the foundational campaign type for any portfolio — it harvests converting search terms and provides a keyword pipeline for SK campaigns. Launch a new SPA campaign for ASIN B0DC69M3YD immediately with a moderate daily budget ($10-15/day). Use "Dynamic bids - down only" to start.
- **Broad coverage for B0C5S1FW5L and B0BWSGRTB1:** These ASINs appear in PT/CAT campaigns but may not have their own Auto coverage. Consider whether each active ASIN needs its own SPA.

## Summary

**What's working:**
- "4 flowers - SPM SK easy embroidery kits for beginners TOS" is the star — 11.11% CVR, 27.66% ACoS, above-10% conversion. Scale this.
- "4 flowers - SPM SK beginners embroidery kit for adults TOS" is a close second — 8.14% CVR, 28.74% ACoS, approaching target. Raise bids to push TOS IS.

**What needs attention:**
- Portfolio CVR at 4.14% is the core problem. Five campaigns (SD video, shield brand self target, PT | 4 flowers, SK embroidery for beginners TOS, shield brand asins) are consuming $204.78/week combined — 49.2% of portfolio spend — with minimal or zero return.
- The absence of any active Auto (SPA) campaign is a structural gap. Without it, the portfolio has no automatic keyword discovery running.

**Quick wins:**
- Pause the SD video TOS push campaign immediately — saves ~$49/week with near-zero return.
- Significantly lower bids on both brand shield campaigns (self target + asins) — saves ~$40-50/week and refocuses those campaigns on their defensive purpose.

**Data Dive checks needed:**
- "4 flowers - SPM SK embroidery for beginners TOS" — check organic rank movement on "embroidery for beginners" before final decision
- "4 flowers - SPM SK beginner needlepoint kits for adults TOS" — check organic rank movement on "beginner needlepoint kits for adults" before cutting
- "4 flowers - SPM SK easy embroidery kits for beginners TOS" — confirm rank is moving upward (this is the primary scaling candidate)
- "4 flowers - SPM SK beginners embroidery kit for adults TOS" — confirm rank trend before raising bids further
