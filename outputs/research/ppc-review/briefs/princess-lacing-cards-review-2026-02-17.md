## Portfolio Overview

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Total Spend | $408.22 | — | — |
| Total Sales | $759.24 | — | — |
| Portfolio ACoS | 53.77% | Flexible (Launch stage — CVR is primary) | Above Target |
| Portfolio ROAS | 1.86 | — | — |
| Total Orders | 38 | — | — |
| Total Clicks | 339 | — | — |
| Portfolio CVR | 11.21% | 10% | OK |
| Active Campaigns | 6 | — | — |

**Stage Notes:** All campaigns launched Dec 2025 – Feb 2026. At Launch stage, ACoS is tolerated above 35% as long as CVR is healthy (>10%). Portfolio CVR of 11.21% is on target — the product is converting. The priority now is identifying which campaigns are bleeding spend without converting and which are actually building rank.

## Action To-Do List

### P1 — Act Now (Highest Impact)

- [ ] **SPM SK lacing cards for kids ages 3-5 TOS**: 0 orders from $12.03 spend over 11 weeks — this keyword is not converting. Pause this campaign or significantly lower bids. Do not keep funding a dead-end keyword.
- [ ] **SPM MK broad TOS**: ACoS 61.78% on $185.16 spend (45% of portfolio). CVR is strong at 14.56% which justifies running it, but bids are too high. Lower TOS bid modifier moderately and monitor. Check Data Dive before cutting to confirm whether this campaign is driving rank movement.

### P2 — Investigate & Adjust

- [ ] **SPA auto**: ACoS 36.28%, CVR 8.90% (just below 10% target). Pull the search term report — identify converting terms to harvest into SK campaigns and add negatives for irrelevant clicks. Auto is doing reasonable work but needs tighter targeting.
- [ ] **SPM SK toddler sewing kit TOS**: Budget is $13/day but only $1.82 was spent — severely under-bidding. Only 1 click total so data is meaningless. Raise bids to spend closer to budget, then evaluate after 2 more weeks of data.
- [ ] **4 dormant SK campaigns (ENABLED, $0 spend)**: All have $0 spend and zero or near-zero impressions. Either bids are too low or keywords are too narrow. Raise bids on each or pause the ones that are clearly irrelevant keyword variants. Do not leave ENABLED campaigns running at $0 indefinitely.

### P3 — Monitor / Scale

- [ ] **SPM MP product targeting**: New campaign (~2.5 weeks old). ACoS 64.65% but CVR 11.11% is solid. Flag as experimental — needs more data before making bid changes. Check again after 4 weeks of run time.
- [ ] **SPM MK lacing root TOS**: New campaign (~2.5 weeks old), only 9 clicks. ACoS 58.31%, CVR 11.11% (1/9). Too early to evaluate — needs more data.

### Structure Gaps

- [ ] **No dedicated catch-all campaign identified**: Consider whether a catch-all broad or auto in a catch-all portfolio exists separately. If not, the SPA auto is serving this function — acceptable at Launch stage.
- [ ] **SK campaigns are largely dormant**: The portfolio has SK campaigns on paper, but most are not spending. At Launch stage this is acceptable, but as the portfolio matures into Growth, these will need to be activated with proper bids or replaced.

## Campaign-by-Campaign Analysis

### 1. SPM MK broad TOS — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Multi-Keyword / TOS Push | — |
| Spend | $185.16 (45.4% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 61.78% | Above flexible Launch target |
| CVR | 14.56% (15 orders / 103 clicks) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $1.80 | — |
| CTR | 5.88% | — |
| Orders | 15 | — |
| Sales | $299.70 | — |
| Budget | $20.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 21.39% | — |
| Age | ~11 weeks (started 12/4/25) | — |

**Assessment:** This is the portfolio's biggest spender and primary driver of orders. CVR of 14.56% is strong — the audience is right, but bids are driving ACoS to 61.78%. As a TOS campaign, some ACoS tolerance is warranted if it is driving ranking. The $185 spend on this campaign alone represents 45% of total portfolio budget.

**Recommendation:** Lower TOS bid modifier moderately (not aggressively — CVR justifies running this). Check Data Dive to confirm rank movement before making any significant cuts. If Data Dive shows no rank improvement, lower bids more aggressively.

### 2. SPM MP product targeting — WATCH (Experimental)

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Product Targeting (PAT) | — |
| Spend | $103.33 (25.3% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 64.65% | Above flexible Launch target |
| CVR | 11.11% (8 orders / 72 clicks) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $1.44 | — |
| CTR | 4.81% | — |
| Orders | 8 | — |
| Sales | $159.84 | — |
| Budget | $8.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 34.40% | — |
| Age | ~2.5 weeks (started 2/1/26) | — |

**Assessment:** Campaign is only ~2.5 weeks old — experimental, needs more data. CVR of 11.11% is a positive early signal. ACoS at 64.65% is high, but at this stage and age, CVR is the primary metric to watch. The 34.4% TOS IS is notable for a PAT campaign — check if this is intentional.

**Recommendation:** Do not adjust bids yet. Monitor for 2 more weeks. Flag for re-evaluation after 4 total weeks of run time. If CVR holds above 10%, begin moderate bid reduction to bring ACoS toward 45-50%.

### 3. SPA auto — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Auto | — |
| Spend | $94.23 (23.1% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 36.28% | At/slightly above flexible Launch target |
| CVR | 8.90% (13 orders / 146 clicks) | Slightly below 10% |
| CPC | $0.65 | — |
| CTR | 1.50% | — |
| Orders | 13 | — |
| Sales | $259.74 | — |
| Budget | $8.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~11 weeks (started 12/3/25) | — |

**Assessment:** The Auto campaign is the most efficient in the portfolio by ACoS (36.28%) and is the best source of search term discovery. CVR at 8.90% is just under the 10% target, which likely means some non-converting terms are eating clicks. Budget of $8/day is modest and may be limiting scale.

**Recommendation:** Pull the search term report immediately. Add negatives for non-converting terms. Harvest any high-converting search terms into SK or MK campaigns. Consider increasing daily budget slightly once negatives are added to improve signal quality.

### 4. SPM SK lacing cards for kids ages 3-5 TOS — FLAG

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Single Keyword / TOS Push | — |
| Spend | $12.03 (2.9% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A | 0 orders — no ACoS to calculate |
| CVR | 0% (0 orders / 8 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $1.50 | — |
| CTR | 6.90% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $20.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 15.08% | — |
| Age | ~11 weeks (started 12/4/25) | — |

**Assessment:** 0 orders from $12.03 spend over 11 weeks is a clear failure signal. This campaign has had enough time to produce results. High CTR (6.90%) suggests the keyword is getting attention, but no one is buying. Either the keyword is attracting the wrong intent, or the listing is not converting for this specific search term.

**Recommendation:** Pause this campaign. The keyword "lacing cards for kids ages 3-5" may be too narrow or age-specific to drive purchase intent. Before fully cutting it, check the search term report to see what exact queries triggered clicks — there may be a better match type or keyword variant worth testing.

### 5. SPM MK lacing root TOS — WATCH (Experimental)

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Multi-Keyword / TOS Push | — |
| Spend | $11.65 (2.9% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 58.31% | Above flexible Launch target |
| CVR | 11.11% (1 order / 9 clicks) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $1.29 | — |
| CTR | 4.57% | — |
| Orders | 1 | — |
| Sales | $19.98 | — |
| Budget | $20.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 12.37% | — |
| Age | ~2.5 weeks (started 2/1/26) | — |

**Assessment:** Campaign is ~2.5 weeks old with only 9 clicks — statistically meaningless. The single order gives a CVR of 11.11% which looks good but cannot be trusted with this sample size. Budget of $20/day vs. $11.65 total spend indicates severe under-spending — bids are likely too low.

**Recommendation:** Experimental — needs more data. Raise bids slightly to get closer to the $20/day budget and generate enough click volume for a valid read. Re-evaluate after 4 total weeks.

### 6. SPM SK toddler sewing kit TOS — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Single Keyword / TOS Push | — |
| Spend | $1.82 (0.4% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 9.11% | Well below target (but 1 click sample) |
| CVR | 100% (1 order / 1 click) | N/A — sample too small |
| CPC | $1.82 | — |
| CTR | 100% (1 impression / 1 click) | N/A — sample too small |
| Orders | 1 | — |
| Sales | $19.98 | — |
| Budget | $13.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 50% | — |
| Age | ~4 weeks (started 1/21/26) | — |

**Assessment:** Only 1 impression and 1 click — data is not meaningful. However, the campaign is ENABLED with a $13/day budget and has barely spent anything in its first 4 weeks. This is a clear under-bidding situation. The keyword "toddler sewing kit" may be a strong adjacent keyword worth testing properly.

**Recommendation:** Raise bids significantly to generate actual traffic. This campaign needs at least 30-50 clicks before any performance evaluation is possible. If bids are raised and it still cannot spend, consider whether "toddler sewing kit" is a relevant match for this product.

## Dormant Campaigns (ENABLED but no activity)

| Campaign | Budget | Start Date | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|------------|----------------|
| princess lacing - SPM SK sewing cards for kids ages 4-8 TOS | $20.00/day | 12/4/25 | Started 11 weeks ago with 0 spend — raise bids significantly or pause. Likely severe under-bid. |
| princess lacing - SPM SK sewing cards for kids ages 3-5 TOS | $20.00/day | 12/4/25 | Started 11 weeks ago with 0 spend — raise bids significantly or pause. Same issue as above. |
| princess lacing - SPM SK lacing cards for kids ages 4-8 TOS | $30.00/day | 12/4/25 | 1 impression, 0 clicks, 0 spend — bids are effectively at $0. Raise bids or pause. |
| princess lacing - SPM SK gem art sticker lacing cards TOS | $20.00/day | 12/8/25 | 0 spend since 12/8/25 — "gem art sticker lacing cards" may be an irrelevant keyword combination. Evaluate relevance before raising bids. Consider pausing. |

**Note:** Having 4 ENABLED campaigns with zero spend and budgets of $20-30/day is a structural issue. Either bids are dramatically below market rate, or these keywords are not being searched. Prioritize auditing bids on each and pausing any keyword that is not relevant to the product.

## Structure Check

| Required Type | Present? | Campaign | Status |
|--------------|----------|----------|--------|
| Auto | Yes | princess lacing - SPA auto | Healthy — active, spending, converting |
| Broad / MK | Yes | princess lacing - SPM MK broad TOS | Active — high spend, high CVR, high ACoS |
| Product Targeting | Yes | princess lacing - SPM MP product targeting | Active — experimental (<3 weeks) |
| Single Keyword | Yes (on paper) | Multiple SK campaigns | Needs work — most are dormant |

**Gaps:**
- **SK campaigns are present but non-functional**: 4 of the 5 SK campaigns are dormant (0 spend). Only `SPM SK toddler sewing kit TOS` and `SPM SK lacing cards for kids ages 3-5 TOS` have any spend, and the latter has 0 orders. The SK layer is theoretically present but practically absent.
- **No Brand Shield campaign identified**: Not critical at Launch stage, but worth noting for when the portfolio moves to Growth.
- **No catch-all campaign in a separate catch-all portfolio**: At Launch stage this is acceptable — the Auto campaign is serving discovery purposes. Flag for future structure review.

## Summary

**What's working:**
- Portfolio CVR of 11.21% is above the 10% target — the product is converting when shown to relevant customers.
- SPA auto is doing efficient discovery work at 36.28% ACoS with decent order volume — strong foundation for search term harvesting.

**What needs attention:**
- SPM MK broad TOS is consuming 45% of portfolio budget at 61.78% ACoS — bids need to come down moderately, especially the TOS modifier. This is the single highest-impact lever in the portfolio.
- SPM SK lacing cards for kids ages 3-5 TOS has spent $12.03 over 11 weeks with 0 orders — this campaign should be paused now.

**Quick wins:**
- Pull the SPA auto search term report and add negatives immediately — this will improve CVR and ACoS on the best-performing campaign without changing any bids.
- Pause `SPM SK lacing cards for kids ages 3-5 TOS` — it is bleeding $12+ with zero return over 11 weeks.

**Data Dive checks needed:**
- `princess lacing - SPM MK broad TOS`: Verify whether this TOS campaign is driving rank movement before reducing bids. If rank is improving, the elevated ACoS is justified. If not, lower bids more aggressively.
- `princess lacing - SPM MP product targeting`: Confirm TOS IS of 34.4% is intentional for a PAT campaign — this is unusually high and may indicate bid settings need review.
