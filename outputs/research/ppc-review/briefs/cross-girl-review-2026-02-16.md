## Portfolio Overview

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Total Spend | $529.48 | — | — |
| Total Sales | $1,590.88 | — | — |
| Portfolio ACoS | 33.28% | 30% | Above Target |
| Portfolio ROAS | 3.00 | — | — |
| Total Orders | 72 | — | — |
| Total Clicks | 542 | — | — |
| Portfolio CVR | 13.28% | 10% | OK |
| Active Campaigns | 11 (8 with meaningful data) | — | — |

**Bottom line:** Portfolio ACoS is 3.3 points above the 30% maintenance target. CVR is healthy at 13.28%. The overshoot is driven primarily by two campaigns: Broad 2 (42.87% ACoS) and SK TOS (69.27% ACoS). Fix those two and portfolio ACoS drops to target range.

## Action To-Do List

### P1 — Act Now (Highest Impact)
- [ ] **Broad 2** ($245.14 spend, 42.87% ACoS): Lower bids and TOS% significantly. This single campaign is 46% of portfolio spend at well-above-target ACoS. CVR is solid (12%) so targeting is right — price per click is the problem.
- [ ] **SK "cross stitch kits for kids" TOS** ($41.52 spend, 69.27% ACoS): Check Data Dive for rank movement on this keyword. If NOT ranking up, lower TOS% substantially and reduce bids. If ranking up, tolerate temporarily but reduce TOS% slightly to bring ACoS closer to 40-50%.

### P2 — Investigate & Adjust
- [ ] **Dog & CAT Exact** ($42.67 spend, 32.85% ACoS, 7.58% CVR): CVR is below 10% threshold. Investigate which specific ASINs/keywords within this campaign are dragging conversion down. Consider negating underperformers.
- [ ] **SD UGC Video** ($6.55 spend, 0 orders): Has 3,962 impressions and 26 DPVs but zero conversions after 9+ months. Evaluate if the creative/targeting is working or if this should be restructured.
- [ ] **Beginner TOS PUSH** ($0.35 spend, 0 orders): Running since May 2025 (~9 months) with almost no activity. Bids are too low to generate meaningful data. Either increase bids to test the keyword or cut the campaign.

### P3 — Monitor / Scale
- [ ] **Video Ad** ($34.40 spend, 16.09% ACoS): Top performer. Consider increasing budget from $15/day to capture more volume at this excellent efficiency.
- [ ] **MK "adult root" TOS** ($27.89 spend, 22.88% ACoS): Strong newer campaign with only 7.81% TOS IS. Consider pushing TOS% higher — there's room to grow while staying within ACoS targets.
- [ ] **Auto** ($87.47 spend, 26.21% ACoS): Healthy and efficient. Could consider modest budget increase from $12/day if it's consistently maxing out.

### Structure Gaps
- [ ] **Cats PAT Vol2** ($0.75 spend): Product targeting campaign with $20/day budget but barely spending. Review if bids are competitive or if the targeted ASINs are still relevant.

## Campaign-by-Campaign Analysis

### 1. B08DDJCQKF Cross stitch girl broad 2 — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Broad (SPM) | — |
| Spend | $245.14 (46.3% of portfolio) | Highest spender |
| ACoS | 42.87% | Well above 30% |
| CVR | 12.04% (26/216) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $1.13 | — |
| CTR | 2.69% | Decent |
| Orders | 26 | — |
| Sales | $571.84 | — |
| Budget | $35.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~31 months (started 7/26/23) | Mature |

**Assessment:** This campaign consumes nearly half the portfolio's spend at an ACoS 13 points above target. However, CVR is solid at 12% — the keywords are converting, shoppers are buying. The problem is CPC is too high at $1.13. This is the single biggest lever to fix portfolio-level ACoS.

**Recommendation:** Lower bids significantly across this campaign. Consider reducing budget from $35 to $25 temporarily while bids settle. The goal is to bring ACoS closer to 30-32% while retaining the converting traffic.

### 2. B08DDJCQKF Cross girl - auto — HEALTHY

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Auto (SPA) | — |
| Spend | $87.47 (16.5% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 26.21% | Below 30% |
| CVR | 18.29% (15/82) | Excellent |
| CPC | $1.07 | — |
| CTR | 5.17% | Strong |
| Orders | 15 | — |
| Sales | $333.68 | — |
| Budget | $12.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~29 months (started 9/9/23) | Mature |

**Assessment:** Strong, reliable performer. ACoS well within target, CVR nearly double the benchmark. CTR at 5.17% indicates strong ad relevance. This is doing exactly what an auto campaign should do in a maintenance-stage portfolio.

**Recommendation:** No changes needed. Consider modest budget increase if it's regularly maxing out $12/day — this campaign is efficient enough to handle more volume.

### 3. Dog & CAT & Safari animals Cross Stitch Kits - SP - Exact — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Product Targeting (PAT) | — |
| Spend | $42.67 (8.1% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 32.85% | Slightly above 30% |
| CVR | 7.58% (5/66) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.65 | Low |
| CTR | 0.69% | Very low |
| Orders | 5 | — |
| Sales | $129.90 | — |
| Budget | $10.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~27 months (started 11/15/23) | Mature |

**Assessment:** Mixed signals. Getting massive impressions (9,553) but very low CTR (0.69%) and CVR below the 10% threshold. This suggests targeting relevance issues — the competitor ASINs being targeted may not have closely matched audiences. The low CPC ($0.65) keeps spend manageable, but the below-threshold CVR is a flag.

**Recommendation:** Investigate which specific ASINs/keywords within this campaign are underperforming. Negate the worst converters. The 0.69% CTR suggests the ad is being shown to shoppers who aren't interested in this product type — targeting refinement is needed.

### 4. B08DDJCQKF Cross stitch girl broad — HEALTHY

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Broad (SPM) | — |
| Spend | $41.90 (7.9% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 26.21% | Below 30% |
| CVR | 21.62% (8/37) | Excellent |
| CPC | $1.13 | — |
| CTR | 1.28% | OK |
| Orders | 8 | — |
| Sales | $159.84 | — |
| Budget | $6.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~31 months (started 7/26/23) | Mature |

**Assessment:** Efficient broad campaign with excellent CVR (21.6%) and ACoS below target. Running alongside Broad 2 with the same CPC but much better results. This suggests the keyword set in this campaign is tighter/more relevant than Broad 2.

**Recommendation:** No changes needed. Solid performer. If Broad 2 gets scaled back, consider whether some of its budget should flow here.

### 5. cross girl - SPM SK cross stitch kits for kids TOS — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Single Keyword TOS Push (SK TOS) | — |
| Spend | $41.52 (7.8% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 69.27% | More than 2x target |
| CVR | 8.33% (3/36) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $1.15 | — |
| CTR | 1.78% | — |
| Orders | 3 | — |
| Sales | $59.94 | — |
| Budget | $25.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 21.43% | Moderate |
| Age | ~2.5 months (started 12/2/25) | New |

**Assessment:** This is a TOS push campaign for the keyword "cross stitch kits for kids." ACoS is more than double the maintenance target AND CVR is below 10%. Being a newer campaign (~2.5 months) and a TOS push, some ACoS tolerance is warranted — but only if it's driving rank movement. 21.43% TOS impression share shows it's getting some top placement but not dominating.

**Recommendation:** **Check Data Dive** for rank movement on "cross stitch kits for kids." This is the critical decision point:
- If ranking up significantly: reduce TOS% slightly to bring ACoS toward 40-50%, continue monitoring
- If rank is flat or declining: lower TOS% substantially and reduce bids. At 69% ACoS with no rank progress, this is burning money.

### 6. Cross girl video ad — TOP PERFORMER

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Sponsored Brands Video (SB2) | — |
| Spend | $34.40 (6.5% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 16.09% | Excellent — well below 30% |
| CVR | 15.63% (10/64) | Excellent |
| CPC | $0.54 | Very efficient |
| CTR | 0.74% | Normal for SBV |
| Orders | 10 | — |
| Sales | $213.80 | — |
| Budget | $15.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 13.40% | — |
| DPV | 128 | Strong detail page views |
| Age | ~21 months (started 5/20/24) | Established |

**Assessment:** Best-performing campaign in the portfolio by far. Lowest ACoS (16%), lowest CPC ($0.54), excellent CVR (15.6%), and 128 DPVs showing strong engagement beyond just clicks. This campaign is generating profitable sales at high efficiency.

**Recommendation:** Increase budget from $15/day. This campaign has proven itself and is likely leaving money on the table at current budget levels. Consider $20-25/day and monitor that ACoS stays under 20%.

### 7. cross girl - SPM MK more general adult root TOS — HEALTHY

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Multi Keyword TOS Push (MK TOS) | — |
| Spend | $27.89 (5.3% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 22.88% | Below 30% |
| CVR | 17.24% (5/29) | Excellent |
| CPC | $0.96 | — |
| CTR | 3.20% | Strong |
| Orders | 5 | — |
| Sales | $121.88 | — |
| Budget | $23.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 7.81% | Low — room to grow |
| Age | ~3 months (started 11/24/25) | Newer |

**Assessment:** Strong newer campaign targeting more general/adult-oriented keywords. Excellent CVR (17.2%), healthy ACoS (22.9%), and strong CTR (3.2%). TOS impression share is only 7.81% — plenty of room to capture more top-of-search traffic.

**Recommendation:** Consider pushing TOS% higher to gain more impression share. With ACoS at 22.9% and target at 30%, there's ~7 points of headroom to push more aggressively for top placement while staying within target.

### 8. cross girl - SD UGC video — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Sponsored Display (SD) | — |
| Spend | $6.55 (1.2% of portfolio) | Low |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | No sales |
| CVR | 0% (0/7) | No conversions |
| CPC | $0.94 | — |
| CTR | 0.18% | Low (normal for SD) |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $3.00/day | — |
| DPV | 26 | Some engagement |
| Viewable Impressions | 397 | — |
| Age | ~9.5 months (started 5/1/25) | Established |

**Assessment:** SD campaign with UGC video creative. Low spend ($6.55) so not bleeding money, but zero orders in 9+ months is concerning. 26 DPVs shows some shoppers are clicking through to the detail page but not buying. Low CTR (0.18%) is normal for SD format. The question is whether this is providing value as a brand awareness / retargeting play, or if it's just dead spend.

**Recommendation:** Evaluate the UGC video creative quality. If the creative is compelling, consider slight bid increase to generate more data. If it's been 9+ months with no conversions, consider pausing and testing a different creative or audience.

### 9. cross girl - SPM brand shield — HEALTHY (DEFENSE)

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Brand Shield | — |
| Spend | $0.84 (0.2% of portfolio) | Minimal — expected |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | — |
| CVR | 0% (0/2) | Too few clicks to judge |
| CPC | $0.42 | Low |
| CTR | 1.32% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $35.00/day | — |
| Age | ~8 months (started 6/11/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Brand defense campaign functioning as expected. Minimal spend ($0.84), low CPC ($0.42), protecting brand terms from competitor bids. The $35/day budget is high for a shield but it's barely spending, which means competitors aren't aggressively bidding on your brand terms.

**Recommendation:** No changes needed. This is working as intended — low cost defense.

### 10. B0B18ZRRCQ - Cats Cross Stitch Kits - CG PAT Vol2 — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Product Targeting (PAT) | — |
| Spend | $0.75 (0.1% of portfolio) | Very low |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | — |
| CVR | 0% (0/2) | Too few clicks to judge |
| CPC | $0.38 | Very low |
| CTR | 3.92% | Decent |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $20.00/day | — |
| Age | ~34 months (started 4/20/23) | Old |

**Assessment:** Product targeting campaign with $20/day budget but spending only $0.75/week. This campaign has been running ~34 months but is barely getting impressions (51). Bids are likely too low to compete in auctions, or the targeted ASINs are low-traffic.

**Recommendation:** Investigate whether the targeted ASINs are still relevant and active. If yes, increase bids to generate meaningful data. If the targeted products have changed or are no longer relevant competitors, update the targeting or cut the campaign.

### 11. cross girl - manual TOS beginner cross stitch kits PUSH — FLAG

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | TOS Push (manual keyword) | — |
| Spend | $0.35 (0.1% of portfolio) | Negligible |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | — |
| CVR | 0% (0/1) | Too few clicks to judge |
| CPC | $0.35 | Very low |
| CTR | 0.96% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $10.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~9.5 months (started 5/1/25) | — |

**Assessment:** TOS push campaign for "beginner cross stitch kits" that's been running 9+ months with virtually zero activity. $10/day budget but only $0.35 spent in the 7-day window. This is a dead campaign — bids are far too low to win any meaningful auctions.

**Recommendation:** Either significantly increase bids to actually test this keyword, or cut the campaign. 9 months of near-zero data means it's taking up space without providing any value. If "beginner cross stitch kits" is an important keyword, it needs proper budget and competitive bids.

## Summary

**What's working:**
- Video ad is the standout performer (16% ACoS, excellent CVR) — scale this
- Auto and Broad campaigns are efficient and reliable (both at 26% ACoS)
- MK adult root TOS is a promising newer campaign with strong metrics and growth potential

**What needs attention:**
- Broad 2 is dragging portfolio ACoS up by ~3 points — it's 46% of spend at 43% ACoS
- SK "cross stitch kits for kids" TOS is at 69% ACoS — needs Data Dive validation

**Quick wins:**
1. Lower bids on Broad 2 — single biggest lever to bring portfolio ACoS to target
2. Increase Video ad budget — most efficient campaign, likely leaving money on the table

**Data Dive checks needed:**
- "cross stitch kits for kids" — is the SK TOS campaign driving rank improvement?
- "beginner cross stitch kits" — is this keyword worth pursuing (currently dead campaign)?
