**Data Window:** Last 7 days (excl. last 2 days)
**Portfolio Stage:** Launch

## Portfolio Overview

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Total Spend | $130.61 | — | — |
| Total Sales | $160.74 | — | — |
| Portfolio ACoS | 81.26% | Flexible (CVR primary) | Well Above |
| Portfolio ROAS | 1.23 | — | — |
| Total Orders | 9 | — | — |
| Portfolio CVR | 4.0% | 10% | Below Target |
| Active Campaigns | 5 | — | — |

> **Note:** All 5 active campaigns started 11/16/25 — approximately 13 weeks old as of this review. The portfolio is in **Launch stage**. ACoS tolerance is higher than normal, but CVR of 4.0% is the primary concern — it is meaningfully below the 10% target and indicates a conversion problem, not just a cost problem.

## Action To-Do List

### P1 — Act Now (Highest Impact)

- [ ] **needlepoint - SPM MK broad and phrase TOS** ($68.78 spend, 95.63% ACoS, 4.04% CVR): Lower bids significantly. This campaign is consuming 52.6% of total portfolio budget with ACoS nearly double what even a loose Launch threshold should tolerate. CVR is also below 10% — the combination signals over-bidding into irrelevant or low-converting traffic. Reduce bids on all match types, pull a search term report to identify and negative-match irrelevant terms. The "up and down" bidding strategy is amplifying overspend — consider switching to "down only" while in Launch.
- [ ] **needlepoint - SPM SK kids needlepoint kit TOS** ($9.61 spend, 0 orders, 0% CVR): 0 orders on 12 clicks. This campaign is spending with zero return. Check the search terms it is serving. Reduce bids moderately. If it continues to generate 0-order clicks in the next 7-day window, pause and investigate keyword relevance.
- [ ] **needlepoint - SPM SK needlepoint kit for kids TOS** ($3.63 spend, 0 orders, 0% CVR): 0 orders on 7 clicks. Same issue as above SK campaign — zero conversion. Note the TOS IS is 24.2%, meaning it is winning top placement but not converting. Lower bids to reduce wasteful TOS spend. Check if this keyword is sufficiently differentiated from the "kids needlepoint kit" SK campaign above — they may be competing with each other.

### P2 — Investigate & Adjust

- [ ] **needlepoint - SPA auto TOS** ($34.77 spend, 65.78% ACoS, 4.00% CVR): Pull the search term report. Auto campaigns at Launch stage frequently surface irrelevant terms and inflate ACoS. Identify top spending search terms with no orders and add them as negatives. CVR of 4.0% suggests the listing or price/main image may be creating friction even when the right customer lands — worth checking. Reduce bids slightly to slow spend while you clean up targeting.
- [ ] **needlepoint - SPM SK needlepoint kits for beginners TOS** ($13.82 spend, 38.43% ACoS, 6.25% CVR): ACoS is in the 30-40% band and CVR is below 10% — needs monitoring. CVR of 6.25% is the best in the portfolio among campaigns with orders. This is the healthiest performing SK campaign. Minor bid reduction is warranted to bring ACoS toward a more manageable level while maintaining impressions. Do not cut aggressively — this keyword has real conversion signal.

### P3 — Monitor / Scale

- [ ] No campaigns are currently in a healthy maintain/scale state. Revisit after P1 actions are taken and 7-day data refreshes.

### Structure Gaps

- [ ] **Product Targeting (PAT) campaign missing**: No PAT campaign exists in this portfolio. Per SOP, a PAT campaign targeting 3-5 competitor/complementary ASINs should be added. This is a Launch-stage gap — add it now to diversify traffic sources.
- [ ] **Broad campaign missing (standalone)**: The MK campaign includes broad + phrase match but there is no dedicated broad-match campaign structured for broad keyword discovery separately. At Launch stage this is acceptable given the MK broad coverage, but flag for review as the portfolio moves to Growth.
- [ ] **Review bidding strategy on MK TOS campaign**: The "SPM MK broad and phrase TOS" campaign uses "Dynamic bids - up and down" — this allows Amazon to increase bids by up to 100% at TOS. All other campaigns use "down only." At Launch stage with above-target ACoS, "up and down" is likely driving significant overspend. Change to "down only" unless there is a deliberate TOS push strategy in place.

## Campaign-by-Campaign Analysis

### 1. needlepoint - SPM MK broad and phrase TOS — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Multi Keyword (MK) Broad + Phrase / TOS | — |
| Spend | $68.78 (52.6% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 95.63% | Well Above Launch threshold |
| CVR | 4.04% (4 orders / 99 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.69 | — |
| CTR | 1.74% | — |
| Orders | 4 | — |
| Sales | $71.92 | — |
| Budget | $10.00/day | Hitting budget cap (OUT_OF_BUDGET) |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~13 weeks (started 11/16/25) | — |

**Assessment:** This campaign is the largest spender in the portfolio and is running at a nearly 1:1 spend-to-sales ratio. The OUT_OF_BUDGET status means it is capping out its daily budget every day, yet CVR is only 4% — indicating the traffic it attracts is broadly mismatched or the listing is not converting well. The "up and down" bidding strategy may be amplifying bids at TOS and burning through budget faster than intended.

**Recommendation:** (1) Switch bidding strategy from "up and down" to "down only" immediately. (2) Pull search term report and add negatives for irrelevant or high-spend/no-order terms. (3) Lower bids significantly across the ad group — start with a 20-25% reduction and monitor for 7 days. (4) Do not increase budget cap until ACoS improves.

### 2. needlepoint - SPA auto TOS — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Auto (SPA) | — |
| Spend | $34.77 (26.6% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 65.78% | Above Launch threshold |
| CVR | 4.00% (3 orders / 75 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.46 | — |
| CTR | 1.30% | — |
| Orders | 3 | — |
| Sales | $52.86 | — |
| Budget | $5.00/day | Hitting budget cap (OUT_OF_BUDGET) |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~13 weeks (started 11/16/25) | — |

**Assessment:** The auto campaign is also hitting its budget cap daily. At 65.78% ACoS and 4% CVR it is over-spending relative to returns. Auto campaigns at Launch stage are expected to have higher ACoS as they explore, but this needs active management — the search term report will reveal what traffic is being captured. The low $5/day budget is hitting its ceiling, meaning impressions are being throttled. However, increasing budget at this ACoS would accelerate waste.

**Recommendation:** (1) Pull search term report and add negatives for irrelevant terms (close variants, unrelated product types). (2) Lower default bids slightly — reduce close match, loose match bids by ~15%. (3) Do NOT increase the $5 daily budget until ACoS drops below 50%. (4) Use negatives found here to feed into the MK and SK campaigns.

### 3. needlepoint - SPM SK needlepoint kits for beginners TOS — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Single Keyword (SK) — TOS | — |
| Spend | $13.82 (10.6% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 38.43% | Above Launch threshold — monitoring range |
| CVR | 6.25% (2 orders / 32 clicks) | Below 10%, but best CVR with orders |
| CPC | $0.43 | — |
| CTR | 1.50% | — |
| Orders | 2 | — |
| Sales | $35.96 | — |
| Budget | $15.00/day | Not hitting budget cap — underutilized |
| TOS IS | 5.77% | Low — room to grow if CVR improves |
| Age | ~13 weeks (started 11/16/25) | — |

**Assessment:** This is the healthiest campaign in the portfolio among those generating orders. ACoS at 38.43% is high but within a range where the conversion signal (6.25% CVR, moving toward 10%) justifies continued investment at Launch stage. The budget is not being fully utilized, which suggests the bid is not competitive enough to win more impressions at TOS. The TOS IS of 5.77% is low.

**Recommendation:** (1) Minor bid reduction of ~10% to bring ACoS down while preserving volume. (2) Monitor CVR trend — if it approaches 8-10% in next window, hold bids and let the campaign scale naturally. (3) Check Data Dive for rank movement on "needlepoint kits for beginners" — this keyword may be driving organic rank improvement that justifies current spend. (4) Do not pause or aggressively cut — this is the portfolio's most promising keyword.

### 4. needlepoint - SPM SK kids needlepoint kit TOS — FLAG

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Single Keyword (SK) — TOS | — |
| Spend | $9.61 (7.4% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | 0 orders — bleeding spend |
| CVR | 0% (0 orders / 12 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.80 | Highest CPC in portfolio |
| CTR | 2.44% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $8.00/day | Not hitting budget cap |
| TOS IS | 24.76% | High — winning TOS but not converting |
| Age | ~13 weeks (started 11/16/25) | — |

**Assessment:** This campaign is winning a meaningful share of TOS placements (24.76% IS) and generating clicks, but zero orders in this data window. The $0.80 CPC is the highest in the portfolio. The keyword "kids needlepoint kit" may be attracting browsers rather than buyers, or the listing may not be compelling enough at this intent level. At 13 weeks old, this is past the "experimental — needs more data" threshold.

**Recommendation:** (1) Lower bids significantly — reduce CPC target by 25-30%. The high TOS IS suggests over-bidding for this keyword. (2) Review search terms to confirm the keyword is matching as intended (not pulling in unrelated queries). (3) If another 7-day window produces 0 orders, consider pausing and reallocating budget to the "needlepoint kits for beginners" SK campaign which is converting. (4) Check Data Dive for any rank improvement on "kids needlepoint kit" before pausing — TOS activity may be supporting organic rank.

### 5. needlepoint - SPM SK needlepoint kit for kids TOS — FLAG

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Single Keyword (SK) — TOS | — |
| Spend | $3.63 (2.8% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | 0 orders — spending with no return |
| CVR | 0% (0 orders / 7 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.52 | — |
| CTR | 1.79% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $8.00/day | Not hitting budget cap |
| TOS IS | 24.20% | High — similar to Campaign 4 |
| Age | ~13 weeks (started 11/16/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Very similar profile to Campaign 4. "Needlepoint kit for kids" and "kids needlepoint kit" are near-identical keywords being run in two separate SK campaigns. Both are winning TOS impressions but generating zero orders. The combined spend of these two 0-order SK campaigns is $13.24 — more than the best-performing SK campaign (Campaign 3 at $13.82). There may be audience overlap between the two SK campaigns, splitting impressions without meaningful differentiation.

**Recommendation:** (1) Lower bids significantly — same guidance as Campaign 4. (2) Evaluate whether these two SK campaigns should be consolidated into one (the slight keyword variation does not likely justify two separate campaigns at Launch stage with this traffic volume). (3) If zero orders continue in the next 7-day window, pause this campaign and consolidate the keyword into Campaign 4. (4) Check Data Dive for organic rank impact before pausing.

## Dormant Campaigns (ENABLED but no activity)

No ENABLED campaigns were found with zero spend and zero impressions. All 5 ENABLED campaigns had activity in the data window.

*Note: 2 PAUSED and 35 ARCHIVED campaigns were present in the export and excluded from analysis per SOP.*

---

## Structure Check

| Required Type | Present? | Campaign | Status |
|--------------|----------|----------|--------|
| Auto | Yes | needlepoint - SPA auto TOS | Active — hitting budget cap, needs search term cleanup |
| Broad | Yes (in MK) | needlepoint - SPM MK broad and phrase TOS | Active — broad + phrase combined; over-spending |
| Product Targeting (PAT) | No | Missing | Gap — no ASIN/category targeting campaign |
| Single Keyword (SK) | Yes | 3 SK campaigns (beginners, kids kit x2) | Active — 2 of 3 generating 0 orders |

**Gaps:**
- **PAT campaign missing**: No product targeting (ASIN or category) campaign is running. This is a standard SOP requirement. A PAT campaign with 3-5 competitor or complementary product ASINs should be created. This provides a lower-funnel, higher-intent traffic source and is especially valuable at Launch stage for building sales velocity.
- **SK campaign consolidation needed**: Two near-identical SK campaigns ("kids needlepoint kit" and "needlepoint kit for kids") are running simultaneously with zero orders between them. Consider consolidating into one and reallocating budget.
- **Bidding strategy inconsistency**: Campaign 1 (MK TOS) uses "Dynamic bids - up and down" while all others use "down only." This should be standardized unless there is a deliberate reason for the difference.

## Summary

**What's working:**
- "needlepoint kits for beginners" SK campaign has the strongest CVR (6.25%) and a visible TOS IS position, showing this keyword has conversion potential worth protecting.
- The auto campaign is generating the most sales ($52.86) at a lower CPC ($0.46) than manual campaigns — it is a useful keyword discovery vehicle despite the high ACoS.

**What needs attention:**
- Portfolio CVR of 4.0% is the core problem. All 5 campaigns are below the 10% CVR threshold, which means either the traffic quality is off, the listing is not converting, or both. Before bid adjustments alone can fix ACoS, the CVR gap needs to be understood — check the listing main image, price competitiveness, and review count vs. competitors.
- The MK TOS campaign is consuming 52.6% of total spend with 95.63% ACoS and "up and down" bidding. This is the single highest-impact fix in the portfolio.

**Quick wins:**
- Switch MK TOS campaign bidding from "up and down" to "down only" — this alone may reduce overspend at TOS without requiring bid changes.
- Pull search term reports for both the Auto and MK campaigns and add negatives for high-spend/no-order terms — this will improve ACoS across the two largest spenders within days.

**Data Dive checks needed:**
- "needlepoint kits for beginners" (Campaign 3): Check if TOS spend is driving organic rank movement before reducing bids.
- "kids needlepoint kit" (Campaign 4): Check organic rank for this keyword before pausing — 24.76% TOS IS may be contributing to rank improvement even with 0 orders in the ad window.
- "needlepoint kit for kids" (Campaign 5): Same as Campaign 4 — verify rank movement before cutting.
