# PPC Portfolio Review: .Catch All Auto

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Data Window:** Last 7 days (excl. last 2 days)
**Portfolio Stage:** Maintenance
**Portfolio Type:** Catch-All Auto — stricter ACoS thresholds apply (target: 20-25%)

## Portfolio Overview

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Total Spend | $861.51 | — | — |
| Total Sales | $3,861.73 | — | — |
| Portfolio ACoS | 22.31% | 20-25% | OK — within catch-all target range |
| Portfolio ROAS | 4.48 | — | — |
| Total Orders | 159 | — | — |
| Portfolio CVR | 5.66% | 10% | Below Target — investigate relevance |
| Active Campaigns | 6 | — | — |
| Archived/Filtered Out | 2 | — | — |

**Stage Rationale:** Portfolio contains campaigns dating back to March 2023 (~35 months). Order volume is stable (22-23 orders/week at 159 over 7 days). This is a mature, maintenance-phase portfolio running pure auto bidding across multiple bid-tier variants. Focus is on cost control and efficiency.

**CVR Note:** Portfolio CVR of 5.66% is below the 10% target, but this is common for catch-all auto campaigns — they surface broader, less-targeted traffic. Monitor ACoS tightly as the primary health signal.

## Action To-Do List

### P1 — Act Now (Highest Impact)

- [ ] **Catch All - Auto - 0.39 - Incrementum**: ACoS 26.55% is above the 25% catch-all ceiling with low CVR (3.35%) — lower bids slightly or reduce budget from $20/day to $15/day to rein in inefficiency
- [ ] **catch all - auto - 0.19 incrumentum** (new campaign): ACoS 21.55% is acceptable but CVR is only 3.42% for a 12-week-old campaign that is now past the "needs more data" window — check search terms for irrelevant matches and negate aggressively

### P2 — Investigate & Adjust

- [ ] **CATCH ALL NGO - OLD**: Largest spend campaign (40.6% of portfolio) with ACoS 23.91% and CVR 7.79% — both are borderline. Search term audit needed to confirm traffic quality. Consider whether NGO targeting is pulling unqualified clicks.
- [ ] **Catch All - Auto - 0.29 - Incrementum**: ACoS 20.80% is healthy, but CVR 6.52% is below target. At 29.9% of portfolio spend it matters — review search terms to confirm traffic is relevant. If term quality is good, this is a keeper.
- [ ] **Catch All - Auto - 0.49 - Incrementum**: Very low activity (42 clicks, 2 orders, $12.93 spend) despite being 35 months old. Either bids are too low to compete or the $25/day budget is not being utilized. Check impression share loss — if it is bid-limited, this campaign may be redundant given the 0.29 variant is performing better at a lower bid. Consider pausing if it cannot generate meaningful volume.

### P3 — Monitor / Scale

- [ ] **Catch All - Auto - 0.15 - incrementum**: Top performer — ACoS 4.38%, CVR 10.81%. Only $4.46 spend in 7 days though. Campaign is 12 weeks old with $100/day budget but barely spending — bids at $0.12 are likely too low to win impressions. Raise bids to $0.17-0.20 incrementally to capture more volume at this efficiency.

### Structure Gaps

- [ ] **No Broad, Product Targeting, Single Keyword, or Multi-Keyword campaigns present** — entire portfolio is Auto only. At Maintenance stage, having a Broad or Product Targeting (PAT) campaign would help capture known high-converting traffic more deliberately. Recommend raising this with the account manager.
- [ ] **No TOS push campaign** — catch-all auto traffic is unlikely to win top-of-search placements by design; this is expected.

## Campaign-by-Campaign Analysis

### 1. CATCH ALL NGO - OLD — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Auto (Catch-All) | — |
| Spend | $349.36 (40.6% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 23.91% | Within 20-25% catch-all range — borderline top |
| CVR | 7.79% (62 orders / 796 clicks) | Below 10% target |
| CPC | $0.44 | — |
| CTR | 0.92% | — |
| Orders | 62 | — |
| Sales | $1,461.18 | — |
| Budget | $50.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~22.6 months (started 3/30/24) | Established |

**Assessment:** This is the portfolio's dominant campaign by spend — it drives 40.6% of all spend and 37.8% of all sales. ACoS sits at the upper end of the acceptable 20-25% catch-all range. CVR at 7.79% is below the 10% target, suggesting some traffic is not converting. The campaign name includes "NGO" which may indicate a specific targeting grouping — unclear what this means without additional context.

**Recommendation:** Conduct a search term report audit this week. Negate any irrelevant or consistently non-converting terms. If CVR does not improve after negation, consider lowering bids slightly (from $0.44 CPC average, try targeting $0.38-0.40) to reduce ACoS while search term hygiene improves. Do not reduce budget until negation is done.

### 2. Catch All - Auto - 0.29 - Incrementum — HEALTHY

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Auto (Catch-All) | — |
| Spend | $257.56 (29.9% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 20.80% | Within 20-25% catch-all range — solid |
| CVR | 6.52% (53 orders / 813 clicks) | Below 10% target |
| CPC | $0.32 | — |
| CTR | 0.66% | — |
| Orders | 53 | — |
| Sales | $1,238.53 | — |
| Budget | $60.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~35 months (started 3/24/23) | Established |

**Assessment:** Second-largest campaign by spend. Most cost-efficient of the high-volume campaigns at 20.80% ACoS and the highest raw impressions (123,567). CVR of 6.52% is below target, but this campaign has been running 35 months and is delivering consistently. The $0.29 bid tier is proven to drive volume at acceptable efficiency.

**Recommendation:** Maintain current bids and budget. Run a search term review to identify any chronic non-converters for negation. This campaign is a core contributor — no changes unless ACoS climbs above 25% next review cycle.

### 3. catch all - auto - 0.19 incrumentum — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Auto (Catch-All) — New Campaign | — |
| Spend | $119.69 (13.9% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 21.55% | Within 20-25% range but CVR is weak |
| CVR | 3.42% (24 orders / 702 clicks) | Well below 10% target |
| CPC | $0.17 | — |
| CTR | 0.62% | — |
| Orders | 24 | — |
| Sales | $555.48 | — |
| Budget | $100.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~12 weeks (started 11/24/25) | New — past early data window |

**Assessment:** This campaign is 12 weeks old, past the 8-week "experimental" threshold — it should be generating usable data now. CVR of 3.42% is the second-lowest in the portfolio, meaning 97 of every 100 clicks are not converting. Despite a low $0.17 CPC keeping ACoS within range, the conversion signal is poor. At $119.69 spend over 7 days, this is meaningful budget going to low-converting traffic. Budget utilization relative to its $100/day cap is also low (only ~$17/day used), suggesting the low bids are limiting impression quality.

**Recommendation:** Run a search term report and aggressively negate irrelevant or non-converting terms. Do not raise bids until CVR improves — the issue is traffic quality, not bid competitiveness. If CVR does not reach 5%+ after two rounds of negation, consider lowering budget to $50/day to reduce exposure while optimizing.

### 4. Catch All - Auto - 0.39 - Incrementum — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Auto (Catch-All) | — |
| Spend | $117.51 (13.6% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 26.55% | Above 25% catch-all ceiling — flag |
| CVR | 3.35% (14 orders / 418 clicks) | Well below 10% target |
| CPC | $0.28 | — |
| CTR | 0.56% | — |
| Orders | 14 | — |
| Sales | $442.68 | — |
| Budget | $20.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~35 months (started 3/24/23) | Established |

**Assessment:** This is the only campaign currently above the 25% catch-all ACoS ceiling, and it also has the lowest CVR of the active campaigns (3.35%). Despite being 35 months old, it is not performing to standard. The $0.39 bid tier appears to be winning impressions (74,650) but from poor-converting traffic. The $20/day budget is being fully utilized, suggesting bids are competitive but misdirected.

**Recommendation:** This is a P1 action. Lower daily budget to $15/day immediately to reduce bleed. Simultaneously run a search term audit and negate non-converters. If ACoS does not drop below 25% after two review cycles, consider pausing this campaign — the 0.29 tier is doing a better job at lower cost.

### 5. Catch All - Auto - 0.49 - Incrementum — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Auto (Catch-All) | — |
| Spend | $12.93 (1.5% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 20.88% | Within 20-25% catch-all range |
| CVR | 4.76% (2 orders / 42 clicks) | Below 10% target — small sample |
| CPC | $0.31 | — |
| CTR | 0.57% | — |
| Orders | 2 | — |
| Sales | $61.94 | — |
| Budget | $25.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~35 months (started 3/24/23) | Established |

**Assessment:** Very low activity for a 35-month-old campaign with a $25/day budget. Only 42 clicks and 2 orders over 7 days suggests the campaign is barely spending (~$1.85/day actual vs. $25/day budget). ACoS looks acceptable but the sample size (2 orders) is too small to be meaningful. This campaign appears to be losing impression share — possibly outcompeted by the 0.29 and 0.39 variants at this bid tier.

**Recommendation:** Evaluate whether this campaign is pulling materially different traffic from the 0.29 variant. If search term overlap is high, this campaign is redundant — pause it and consolidate budget into the 0.29 tier. If terms are distinct and ACoS holds over a longer window, keep monitoring. Do not increase bids until relevance is confirmed.

### 6. Catch All - Auto - 0.15 - incrementum — TOP PERFORMER

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Auto (Catch-All) — New Campaign | — |
| Spend | $4.46 (0.5% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 4.38% | Well below 25% catch-all ceiling — excellent |
| CVR | 10.81% (4 orders / 37 clicks) | At 10% target |
| CPC | $0.12 | — |
| CTR | 0.64% | — |
| Orders | 4 | — |
| Sales | $101.92 | — |
| Budget | $100.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~12 weeks (started 11/24/25) | New — past early data window |

**Assessment:** Best ACoS in the portfolio by far (4.38%) with CVR hitting exactly 10%. However, this campaign is barely spending — $4.46 over 7 days against a $100/day budget means only $0.64/day actual spend. At $0.12 CPC, the bids are simply too low to win meaningful impression volume. This is an efficiency gem being strangled by under-bidding.

**Recommendation:** Raise bids incrementally from $0.12 to $0.17, then $0.20 over the next two review cycles. Monitor ACoS after each adjustment — allow it to rise to 15% before pausing increases, as the current 4.38% provides significant headroom. Do not raise to the same level as the 0.19 campaign until the pattern is confirmed at higher volume.

## Dormant Campaigns (ENABLED but no activity)

None. All 6 ENABLED campaigns had impressions and spend during the data window.

*Note: 2 ARCHIVED campaigns were filtered out of analysis as required (Catch All - Auto - 0.15 - Incrementum and Catch All - Auto - 0.19 - Incrementum, both archived variants).*

## Structure Check

| Required Type | Present? | Campaign | Status |
|--------------|----------|----------|--------|
| Auto | Yes | All 6 campaigns | Active — portfolio is 100% auto |
| Broad | No | Missing | Not present |
| Product Targeting (PAT) | No | Missing | Not present |
| Single Keyword (SK) | No | Missing | Not present |
| Multi-Keyword (MK) | No | Missing | Not present |

**Gaps:** This portfolio is auto-only — appropriate for a catch-all portfolio by design. Catch-all autos are intentionally broad, so the absence of SK/MK/PAT campaigns within this portfolio is expected. However, if these campaign types do not exist elsewhere in the overall account structure, that is a significant gap that should be addressed at the account level (not the catch-all portfolio level).

**Bid Tier Structure Observation:** The portfolio uses a bid-tier ladder approach (0.15, 0.19, 0.29, 0.39, 0.49) to segment traffic by bid aggressiveness. This is a deliberate structure — the expectation is that higher-bid variants win more competitive placements. Currently, the 0.29 and "NGO - OLD" variants are doing the heaviest lifting. The 0.15 variant shows the best efficiency but minimal volume. The 0.39 and 0.49 variants are underperforming.

## Summary

**What's working:**
- The 0.15 - incrementum new campaign has exceptional ACoS (4.38%) and is hitting the 10% CVR target — it just needs more bid headroom to scale
- The 0.29 - Incrementum campaign is the portfolio workhorse: 35 months running, 20.80% ACoS, highest impressions, solid volume — a proven and stable foundation

**What needs attention:**
- The 0.39 - Incrementum campaign is above the 25% catch-all ceiling with the lowest CVR (3.35%) — it is the portfolio's primary cost leak and needs immediate budget reduction and search term negation
- Portfolio-wide CVR of 5.66% is well below the 10% target — this signals systemic traffic quality issues across all campaigns that a broad search term audit should address

**Quick wins:**
- Reduce the 0.39 campaign budget from $20/day to $15/day immediately — this reduces spend bleed with one click while the search term audit is running
- Raise the 0.15 campaign bids from $0.12 to $0.17 — capturing more volume at the most efficient ACoS in the portfolio is the highest-ROI action available

**Data Dive checks needed:**
- None required — this is an all-auto catch-all portfolio with no TOS push campaigns. No rank movement verification needed.

**SOP Reminder:** Confirm your data export excluded the last 2 days (Feb 15-16) per SOP. If not, ACoS and CVR figures may be slightly understated due to attribution lag on recent orders.
