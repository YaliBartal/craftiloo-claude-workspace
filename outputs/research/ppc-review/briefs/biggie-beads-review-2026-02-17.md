## Action To-Do List

### P1 — Act Now (Highest Impact)

- [ ] **biggie beads - SPM MK broad TOS**: Budget is $35/day and this campaign is the portfolio's engine — it may be hitting budget cap. Check if it's running out of budget daily and raise budget to $50–$60/day to unlock more scale.
- [ ] **biggie beads - SPM MK biggie root TOS**: 15 months old, $20/day budget, 31 impressions, 0 clicks, $0 spend — this is a dead campaign. Investigate bids vs. market — either raise bids meaningfully or pause and reallocate budget.

### P2 — Investigate & Adjust

- [ ] **biggie beads - SPM SK 10mm fuse beads TOS**: Only 2 clicks and 0 orders in this window — not enough data to evaluate. Check if TOS IS of 19.6% is delivering impressions in the right placement. Review the targeted keyword and confirm it has search volume. Flag as experimental — needs more data before any action.
- [ ] **biggie beads - SPM SK biggie beads TOS**: Zero impressions, zero spend despite ENABLED status. Bids are almost certainly too low to compete. Raise bids or investigate keyword competitiveness. If keyword is the same as a winning term in the MK broad TOS, this is duplication — consider consolidating.

### P3 — Monitor / Scale

- [ ] **biggie auto**: ACoS 28.2%, CVR 11.3% — healthy auto campaign. Mine for converting search terms and harvest the strongest ones into dedicated manual campaigns (SK or MK campaigns). No immediate action needed but rich keyword data likely here.
- [ ] **biggie beads - SPM MK broad TOS**: After raising budget, monitor ACoS. If it stays below 30% while scaling, this campaign can absorb significantly more spend. Top performer — protect it.

### Structure Gaps

- [ ] **Product Targeting (PAT) campaign — Missing**: No ASIN/category targeting campaign exists in this portfolio. At Growth stage, a PAT campaign (3-5 competitor ASINs + 2 complementary product targets) should be built to defend and attack product-page real estate.
- [ ] **Single Keyword (SK) campaigns — Non-functional**: Two SK TOS campaigns exist but both are dormant. Once top-converting keywords are confirmed from the auto and broad campaigns, build active SK TOS campaigns with competitive bids.

## Campaign-by-Campaign Analysis

### 1. biggie beads - SPM MK broad TOS — TOP PERFORMER

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | MK Broad + TOS | — |
| Spend | $111.30 (71.5% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 20.25% | Below 35% Growth target |
| CVR | 22.99% (20 orders / 87 clicks) | Well above 10% |
| CPC | $1.28 | — |
| CTR | 0.99% | — |
| Orders | 20 | — |
| Sales | $549.56 | — |
| Budget | $35.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~3 months (started 11/16/25) | — |

**Assessment:** This is the portfolio's primary revenue driver — 71.5% of spend generating 75.5% of total orders with a stellar 23% CVR and a very efficient 20.25% ACoS. TOS IS is <5%, which is expected for a broad-match campaign. The strong CVR confirms the targeting is highly relevant. At only $35/day budget, this campaign is almost certainly hitting its daily cap and leaving money on the table.

**Recommendation:** Raise daily budget to $50–$60/day and monitor performance for 3–5 days. If ACoS holds below 30%, continue raising in increments. Do not lower bids — this campaign is running efficiently and scaling it is the single highest-ROI action available.

### 2. biggie auto — HEALTHY

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Auto (SPA) | — |
| Spend | $42.27 (27.1% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 28.20% | Below 35% Growth target |
| CVR | 11.32% (6 orders / 53 clicks) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $0.80 | — |
| CTR | 2.07% | — |
| Orders | 6 | — |
| Sales | $149.88 | — |
| Budget | $10.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~14 months (started 12/17/24) | — |

**Assessment:** Solid auto campaign performing within range — ACoS at 28.2% with CVR just above the 10% threshold. At 14 months running, this is a mature campaign with a rich search-term history. The $10/day budget is a constraint. CTR of 2.07% is the strongest in the portfolio, suggesting the auto placements are landing on relevant searches.

**Recommendation:** Pull the search term report and harvest any converting keywords (especially those with 2+ orders in the last 30–60 days) into the MK broad TOS or dedicated SK campaigns. Consider a modest budget increase to $15/day to keep discovery running. Maintain current bids — do not lower.

### 3. biggie beads - SPM SK 10mm fuse beads TOS — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | SK TOS | — |
| Spend | $2.10 (1.35% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | — |
| CVR | 0% (0 orders / 2 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $1.05 | — |
| CTR | 0.98% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $11.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 19.64% | — |
| Age | ~3 months (started 11/16/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Too early to make a definitive call — only 2 clicks in the data window means there is no statistically meaningful conversion data. TOS IS of 19.6% shows the campaign is winning top-of-search placements, which is the goal. The issue is volume: only 204 impressions suggests the keyword "10mm fuse beads" may have limited search volume, a narrow match, or that bids need to be raised to compete for more impressions.

**Recommendation:** Flag as experimental — needs at least 20–30 clicks before any bid decision. Over the next 2–3 weeks: check if impressions are growing. If TOS IS is above 20% but impressions remain low, the keyword pool is simply small. If impressions are growing, allow the campaign to accumulate data. Do not pause yet. Do NOT cut based on 2 clicks.

## Dormant Campaigns (ENABLED but no activity)

| Campaign | Budget | Start Date | Impressions | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| biggie beads - SPM MK biggie root TOS | $20.00/day | 11/17/24 | 31 | Dead campaign — 15 months old, nearly zero activity. Raise bids significantly to test viability OR pause and reallocate the $20/day budget. |
| biggie beads - SPM SK biggie beads TOS | $8.00/day | 11/16/25 | 0 | Zero impressions — bids are too low to enter auction. Raise bids or investigate if the keyword "biggie beads" is relevant/competitive. Check for keyword duplication with the MK broad TOS campaign. |

## Structure Check

| Required Type | Present? | Campaign | Status |
|--------------|----------|----------|--------|
| Auto | Yes | biggie auto | Healthy — active and converting |
| Broad | Yes | biggie beads - SPM MK broad TOS | Healthy — top performer, budget-constrained |
| Product Targeting (PAT) | No | Missing | Gap — no ASIN/category targeting campaign exists |
| Single Keyword (SK) | Partial | biggie beads - SPM SK 10mm fuse beads TOS / biggie beads - SPM SK biggie beads TOS | Both dormant or minimal. SK TOS structure exists but is not functional yet. |

**Gaps:**
- **PAT campaign is completely missing.** At Growth stage, product targeting is a priority build. Create a PAT campaign with 3–5 individual competitor ASINs (the most direct product-page competitors) and 2 complementary category targets. This is a significant structural hole.
- **SK campaigns are non-functional.** Until keyword winners are confirmed from the auto and broad search term reports, the SK TOS campaigns cannot be properly bid. This is a data dependency — mine the search term reports first, then activate SK campaigns with conviction.

## Summary

**What's working:**
- The MK broad TOS campaign is exceptional — 22.99% CVR and 20.25% ACoS with 20 orders. This is the portfolio's core and it is performing beyond Growth-stage expectations.
- The auto campaign is healthy with 11.3% CVR, running efficiently and generating keyword discovery data.

**What needs attention:**
- The MK broad TOS campaign is almost certainly budget-capped at $35/day — the immediate highest-priority action is raising that budget to unlock scale.
- Two dormant SK TOS campaigns and a dead MK TOS campaign are consuming zero revenue but occupying budget allocations ($39/day combined). Reassign or revive.

**Quick wins:**
- Raise biggie beads - SPM MK broad TOS budget from $35 to $55/day — this is the single action with the highest immediate revenue impact. Current ACoS is 22.26% with room to scale.
- Pull the auto campaign's search term report and identify 2–3 converting keywords to harvest into the existing MK broad TOS or a new SK campaign — free keyword intelligence sitting unused.

**Data Dive checks needed:**
- **biggie beads - SPM MK biggie root TOS**: Before pausing this 15-month-old campaign, check Data Dive to confirm it has not contributed to organic rank movement. If it has driven rank gains, the $0 spend this week may simply be a bidding issue rather than failure.
- **biggie beads - SPM SK 10mm fuse beads TOS**: Verify in Data Dive whether "10mm fuse beads" or related terms have rank movement — the 19.6% TOS IS suggests it may be contributing to rank even with minimal click data.
