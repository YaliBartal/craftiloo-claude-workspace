# PPC Portfolio Review: Latch Hook Kits

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Data Window:** Last 7 days (excl. last 2 days)
**Portfolio Stage:** Launch / Early Growth

> Note: This portfolio has a mix of very old campaigns (Nov 2023, 2024) and a large cluster of newer campaigns launched Sep–Dec 2025. Order volume (18 orders/week) sits at the lower end of Growth stage thresholds. Stage assessed as **Late Launch / Early Growth** — ACoS target ~35%, primary focus on CVR and identifying which campaigns convert.

## Portfolio Overview

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Total Spend | $134.94 | — | — |
| Total Sales | $411.60 | — | — |
| Portfolio ACoS | 32.78% | ~35% | OK (within target) |
| Portfolio ROAS | 3.05x | — | — |
| Total Orders | 18 | — | — |
| Portfolio CVR | 11.39% (18/158) | 10% | OK (above target) |
| Active Campaigns (with data) | 10 | — | — |

**Portfolio is technically within target** — but the ACoS and CVR are being carried almost entirely by 2 campaigns (SPM for kids root TOS + Auto). The product targeting campaign is silently bleeding $25/week with zero returns.

## Action To-Do List

### P1 — Act Now (Highest Impact)

- [ ] **latch hook - manual - product targeting**: Audit all targets inside this campaign. It has spent $25.24 in this window (18.7% of portfolio spend) with 0 orders across nearly 10 months of running. Either overhaul all targets with fresh ASINs or pause the campaign immediately.
- [ ] **B08FYH13CL latch video manual**: ACoS is 40.19% with CVR below 10% (8.33%). Lower bids on underperforming video placements. Do not cut yet — evaluate DPV (91 detail page views) and check if this is driving any downstream rank lift in Data Dive before making a final call.

### P2 — Investigate & Adjust

- [ ] **latch hook kits - manual TOS competitor keyword push**: 12-month-old campaign, 0 orders ever, spending $4.52/week. Check Data Dive to confirm whether this has contributed to rank movement on competitor terms. If no rank signal, pause it — it is not converting.
- [ ] **latch hook kits exact TOS push**: 19-month-old campaign with a $55/day budget delivering only $2.04/week — severely under-delivering. Either bids are too low to compete or the exact keywords are too narrow. Raise bids significantly or restructure the keyword list.
- [ ] **Latch Hook kits - SP - Product Target**: 27-month-old PAT campaign spending only $1.33/week with 0 orders. Likely under-bidding. Refresh ASIN targets (competitors' top BSR products) and raise bids to at least test competitiveness.
- [ ] **latch hook - SPM SK hook rug kits for kids TOS**: ~10 weeks old, 0 orders, $5.22 spend. CTR is decent (2.98%) but not converting. Check search term report — confirm keyword match quality before adjusting bids.
- [ ] **latch hook - SPM MK latch hook kit root TOS**: Only $1.14 spend with 1 click → 1 order (ACoS 5.71%). Severely under-bidding. Raise bids and/or increase budget to let this campaign spend — it is showing strong efficiency signals.
- [ ] **Latch Hook kits - SP - Exact**: 27 months old, $0.64 spend, 0 orders. Near-dead. Review the keyword list — if keywords are still relevant, raise bids substantially. If irrelevant, consider folding them into the Broad campaign (once re-activated) and pausing this.

### P3 — Monitor / Scale

- [ ] **latch hook - SPM for kids root TOS**: Top performer at 24.68% ACoS and 16.98% CVR. Monitor performance. If ACoS stays below 28% over the next 7 days, consider increasing daily budget beyond the current $21/day to capture more volume.
- [ ] **Latch Hook kits - SP - Auto**: Top performer at 13.76% ACoS and 20% CVR. Budget is only $6/day — highly efficient but capped. Raise budget to $10–12/day and harvest high-converting search terms into dedicated SK campaigns.

### Structure Gaps

- [ ] **Broad campaign (PAUSED)**: "Latch Hook kits - SP - Broad" is paused. A broad match campaign is required per SOP as the primary keyword discovery and scale vehicle alongside Auto. Evaluate whether to re-activate with refreshed keywords or build a new SPM Broad campaign.
- [ ] **Auto budget is too low**: $6/day budget on the best-converting campaign in the portfolio is a structural constraint. Increase to at least $10/day.

## Campaign-by-Campaign Analysis

### 1. latch hook - SPM for kids root TOS — TOP PERFORMER

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | TOS Push (Manual SP, Single/Multi Keyword) | — |
| Spend | $56.70 (42.0% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 24.68% | Below 35% target |
| CVR | 16.98% (9 orders / 53 clicks) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $1.07 | — |
| CTR | 1.48% | — |
| Orders | 9 | — |
| Sales | $229.78 | — |
| Budget | $21.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 27.60% | — |
| Age | ~7 months (started 7/20/25) | — |

**Assessment:** This is the portfolio's primary revenue driver, accounting for 42% of spend but generating 55.8% of total sales. ACoS is well inside target and CVR is strong at 17%. Top-of-search impression share is healthy at 27.6%.

**Recommendation:** Maintain current bids. If ACoS stays below 28% for another full 7-day window, increase daily budget to $28–30/day to capture additional TOS volume. Do not change bids — the efficiency is working.

### 2. latch hook - manual - product targeting — FLAG (URGENT)

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Product Targeting (PAT) | — |
| Spend | $25.24 (18.7% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | No sales generated |
| CVR | 0% (0 orders / 25 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $1.01 | — |
| CTR | 1.21% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $5.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~10 months (started 4/10/25) | — |

**Assessment:** This campaign has spent a significant portion of the portfolio budget for 10 months with zero conversions. The CTR suggests impressions are reaching real buyers, but no one is purchasing — indicating either poor ASIN targets (wrong competitor set), weak listing conversion rate, or both. This is the single biggest drain on the portfolio.

**Recommendation:** Pause immediately while you audit the target ASINs. Pull the search term/target report and identify what you have been targeting. Replace all targets with 3–5 top-BSR competitor ASINs that are closely matched to your product (price, type, audience). Re-enable only after target overhaul.

### 3. B08FYH13CL latch video manual — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Video (SB2) | — |
| Spend | $24.09 (17.9% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 40.19% | Above 35% target |
| CVR | 8.33% (3 orders / 36 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.67 | — |
| CTR | 1.12% | — |
| Orders | 3 | — |
| Sales | $59.94 | — |
| Budget | $10.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 25.47% | — |
| DPV | 91 | — |
| Age | ~21 months (started 5/5/24) | — |

**Assessment:** ACoS is above target and CVR is below 10%, which normally triggers a P1 action. However, this is a video/SB2 campaign — lower CVR is expected due to the format, and DPV of 91 indicates meaningful traffic to the detail page. The 25.47% TOS impression share suggests this is doing real awareness work. At 21 months old, it is not a new campaign and should be performing better.

**Recommendation:** Lower bids slightly on the lowest-performing placements (not top-of-search). Check Data Dive for any correlation between this video campaign's TOS IS and organic rank movement before making a final budget call. Do not pause — let the Data Dive check inform the decision.

### 4. Latch Hook kits - SP - Auto — TOP PERFORMER

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Auto (SPA) | — |
| Spend | $14.02 (10.4% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 13.76% | Well below 35% target |
| CVR | 20.00% (5 orders / 25 clicks) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $0.56 | — |
| CTR | 1.03% | — |
| Orders | 5 | — |
| Sales | $101.90 | — |
| Budget | $6.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~27 months (started 11/16/23) | — |

**Assessment:** The Auto campaign is the most efficient campaign in the portfolio. At 13.76% ACoS and 20% CVR, it is significantly outperforming every other campaign. The $6/day budget is a bottleneck — this campaign is almost certainly hitting its budget cap and leaving profitable clicks on the table.

**Recommendation:** Increase daily budget to $10–12/day immediately. Pull the search term report and identify the top 2–3 converting search terms to harvest into dedicated SK campaigns. This is the most immediate scale opportunity in the portfolio.

### 5. latch hook - SPM SK hook rug kits for kids TOS — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | TOS Push (SK) | — |
| Spend | $5.22 (3.9% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | No sales generated |
| CVR | 0% (0 orders / 5 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $1.04 | — |
| CTR | 2.98% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $15.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 28.46% | — |
| Age | ~10 weeks (started 12/7/25) | — |

**Assessment:** At ~10 weeks old, this SK TOS campaign is just past the experimental threshold. CTR is the strongest in the portfolio at 2.98% and TOS IS is solid at 28.46% — people are seeing and clicking the ad. The problem is conversion. This could indicate keyword-to-listing mismatch or listing CRO issues rather than a campaign problem.

**Recommendation:** Check search term report to confirm the keyword is triggering for "hook rug kits for kids" specifically. If match quality looks good, this is a listing/product conversion issue, not a bid issue. Hold bids steady for another 7-day window before adjusting. Check Data Dive for rank movement on this keyword.

### 6. latch hook kits - manual TOS competitor keyword push — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | TOS Push (Manual, competitor keyword) | — |
| Spend | $4.52 (3.35% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | No sales generated |
| CVR | 0% (0 orders / 5 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.90 | — |
| CTR | 1.42% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $15.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 16.33% | — |
| Age | ~12 months (started 2/5/25) | — |

**Assessment:** This campaign has been running for 12 months targeting competitor keywords with zero conversions. Competitor keyword targeting is high-funnel by nature, but after a full year there should be at least some conversion signal. This is likely targeting generic competitor brand terms that do not convert well for a non-branded product, or the TOS IS of 16.33% is insufficient to drive meaningful volume.

**Recommendation:** Check Data Dive for any organic rank movement on these competitor terms. If no rank signal is found, pause this campaign. If rank movement is observed, it may be worth keeping at a minimal budget. Do not continue at current spend without a clear Data Dive justification.

### 7. latch hook kits exact TOS push — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | TOS Push (Exact match) | — |
| Spend | $2.04 (1.51% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | No sales generated |
| CVR | 0% (0 orders / 3 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.68 | — |
| CTR | 0.92% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $55.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~19 months (started 7/3/24) | — |

**Assessment:** This campaign has a $55/day budget but is spending only $2.04/week — a 97% budget utilization gap. This means the bids are far too low to compete for TOS placement on these exact-match keywords, which is confirmed by the <5% TOS IS. At 19 months old with 0 orders, this campaign has never worked in its current configuration.

**Recommendation:** Either raise bids significantly to actually compete for the exact keyword terms (check what bid is needed to reach TOS), or accept that these keywords are too competitive for the current product/listing and pause the campaign. At $0.68 CPC and <5% TOS IS, the bids need to roughly double to be relevant. Test with a meaningful bid increase for one week.

### 8. Latch Hook kits - SP - Product Target — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Product Targeting (PAT) | — |
| Spend | $1.33 (0.99% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | No sales generated |
| CVR | 0% (0 orders / 4 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.33 | — |
| CTR | 1.95% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $25.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~27 months (started 11/16/23) | — |

**Assessment:** At 27 months old with $25/day budget but only $1.33/week spend and 0 orders, this campaign is effectively dead. The extremely low CPC ($0.33) combined with near-zero spend suggests bids are well below what is needed to win product page placements.

**Recommendation:** Audit the target ASINs — at 27 months old, the competitor ASIN set is certainly stale. Refresh with 5–8 currently top-ranked competitor ASINs. Raise bids to be competitive. If the campaign fails to spend meaningfully after refreshing targets and raising bids, consolidate into the "latch hook - manual - product targeting" campaign (once that one is fixed) and pause this one.

### 9. latch hook - SPM MK latch hook kit root TOS — WATCH (Underutilized)

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | TOS Push (MK) | — |
| Spend | $1.14 (0.85% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 5.71% | Well below 35% target |
| CVR | 100% (1 order / 1 click) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $1.14 | — |
| CTR | 1.22% | — |
| Orders | 1 | — |
| Sales | $19.98 | — |
| Budget | $15.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 7.86% | — |
| Age | ~5 months (started 9/10/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Only 1 click and 1 order this week — a tiny sample — but the efficiency signal is exceptional at 5.71% ACoS. The 7.86% TOS IS with a $15/day budget suggests this campaign is under-bidding significantly and not capturing available volume. The root keyword appears to be converting well.

**Recommendation:** Raise bids meaningfully to increase TOS IS from 7.86% toward 20–25%. With only 1 click of data, proceed carefully — raise bids in one moderate step (not aggressively) and monitor for 7 days. If efficiency holds above a 25% ACoS threshold, continue scaling.

### 10. Latch Hook kits - SP - Exact — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Exact Match (SP) | — |
| Spend | $0.64 (0.47% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | No sales generated |
| CVR | 0% (0 orders / 1 click) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.64 | — |
| CTR | 0.49% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $15.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~27 months (started 11/16/23) | — |

**Assessment:** The lowest CTR in the active portfolio (0.49%) combined with near-zero spend on a $15/day budget over 27 months indicates this campaign has been effectively inactive for a very long time. It is occupying budget headroom and adding complexity without contributing.

**Recommendation:** Review the keyword list. If keywords overlap with the "latch hook kits exact TOS push" campaign (campaign #7), consolidate and pause this one to reduce structural complexity. If keywords are unique and relevant, raise bids to see if they can generate activity — but given 27 months of near-zero performance, the bar for keeping this campaign is high.

## Dormant Campaigns (ENABLED but no activity)

| Campaign | Budget | Start Date | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|------------|----------------|
| latch hook - SPM SK latch hook kits for kids TOS | $15.00/day | 9/10/25 | Check if bids are set — if <$0.75 CPC for TOS, raise significantly. If already bidding competitively and still getting 0 impressions, pause and investigate keyword relevance. |
| latch hook - SPM SK latch hook kits for beginners TOS | $15.00/day | 9/7/25 | Same as above — check bid level first. "Beginners" modifier may be too narrow. Consider consolidating keyword into the MK campaign. |
| latch hook - SPM SK beginner latch hook kits for kids TOS | $15.00/day | 9/10/25 | 21 impressions but 0 clicks — extremely low CTR (not even measurable). Bid is too low to win meaningful impressions. Either raise bids to be competitive for TOS or evaluate whether this keyword variant is worth a standalone campaign. |

## Structure Check

| Required Type | Present? | Campaign | Status |
|--------------|----------|----------|--------|
| Auto | Yes | Latch Hook kits - SP - Auto | Healthy — top performer, budget needs increase |
| Broad | No | Latch Hook kits - SP - Broad (PAUSED) | GAP — broad campaign is paused, no active broad discovery running |
| Product Targeting | Yes | latch hook - manual - product targeting / Latch Hook kits - SP - Product Target | Needs work — both PAT campaigns have 0 orders, one is bleeding significantly |
| Single Keyword (TOS) | Yes | Multiple SK TOS campaigns | Partially healthy — main TOS SK campaign (#5) is active; 3 SK TOS campaigns are dormant |
| Multi Keyword (TOS) | Yes | latch hook - SPM MK latch hook kit root TOS | Under-bidding — needs bid increase to spend |
| Video | Yes | B08FYH13CL latch video manual | Watch — ACoS above target, DPV reasonable, check Data Dive |

**Gaps:**
1. **Broad campaign is PAUSED** — This is a significant structural gap. The Broad campaign is the primary scaling vehicle alongside Auto for discovering high-volume converting keywords. Without it, the portfolio has no broad match exploration. Re-activate or build a new SPM Broad campaign with your best-performing keywords from the Auto search term report.
2. **PAT campaigns are broken** — Both product targeting campaigns have run with 0 orders. The target ASIN sets need an overhaul across both campaigns.
3. **3 SK TOS campaigns are dormant** — Too many SK campaigns with no activity creates structural bloat. Audit bids across all three dormant SK TOS campaigns and either activate them properly or consolidate keywords.

---

## Summary

**What's working:**
- "latch hook - SPM for kids root TOS" is carrying the portfolio — 55.8% of sales, 24.68% ACoS, 17% CVR. This is a strong, proven campaign.
- The Auto campaign is the most capital-efficient campaign in the portfolio (13.76% ACoS, 20% CVR) and is budget-capped at $6/day — an easy scale opportunity.

**What needs attention:**
- "latch hook - manual - product targeting" is the #1 problem: 18.7% of portfolio spend, 0 orders, 10 months of data. This campaign should be paused and overhauled immediately — it is the biggest leak in the portfolio.
- The Broad campaign is PAUSED, creating a structural gap in keyword discovery. Without broad match running alongside Auto, the portfolio cannot scale keyword coverage efficiently.

**Quick wins:**
1. Pause "latch hook - manual - product targeting" immediately — stops $25/week of zero-return spend.
2. Raise the Auto campaign budget from $6/day to $10–12/day — the lowest-risk, highest-confidence scale move available right now.

**Data Dive checks needed:**
- "B08FYH13CL latch video manual" — verify if its TOS IS is correlated with organic rank movement before reducing bids.
- "latch hook kits - manual TOS competitor keyword push" — check for rank movement on competitor terms before pausing.
- "latch hook kits exact TOS push" — check if this is driving any rank on the target exact-match keywords despite low TOS IS.
- "latch hook - SPM SK hook rug kits for kids TOS" — check rank movement on "hook rug kits for kids" before concluding it is a campaign issue vs. a listing issue.
