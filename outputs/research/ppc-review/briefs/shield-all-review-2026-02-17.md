## Action To-Do List

### P1 — Act Now (Highest Impact)

*No P1 actions required.* All active campaigns are performing within healthy ranges for a Brand Shield portfolio.

### P2 — Investigate & Adjust

- [ ] **shield product - latch hook pillow**: Low click volume (10 clicks, 1 order) — not enough data to be confident. Monitor for another week or consider raising bids slightly to generate more impressions and validate CVR signal. Campaign is 6 months old but under-budgeted relative to peers.
- [ ] **shield product - cross stitch kits**: TOS IS is low at 7.6% — check Data Dive to confirm this campaign is not losing rank on branded/shield terms. If rank is slipping, consider raising bids slightly to defend position.

### P3 — Monitor / Scale

- [ ] **shield product - latch hook kits**: Healthy at 24.42% ACoS and 13.64% CVR — maintain current bids and monitor.
- [ ] **shield brand name - manual and broad**: Top performer with >95% TOS IS, 16.45% ACoS, and 21.05% CVR — maintain current bids. This campaign is doing exactly what a brand name shield campaign should do.
- [ ] **shield product - latch hook pillow**: Once data volume increases, re-evaluate performance and allocate budget accordingly.

### Structure Gaps

- [ ] **7 paused campaigns**: Review whether any paused shield campaigns (bunny knitting, embroidery for kids, dessert sewing, fairy sewing exact, mini fuse beads, cross and embroidery, cat knitting) should remain in the portfolio or be archived. If these product lines are still active, evaluate whether shield coverage is needed.

## Campaign-by-Campaign Analysis

### 1. shield product - cross stitch kits — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Brand Shield (product targeting, manual) | — |
| Spend | $88.94 (43.8% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 28.9% | Below 30% target |
| CVR | 10.81% (12/111) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $0.80 | — |
| CTR | 1.59% | — |
| Orders | 12 | — |
| Sales | $307.72 | — |
| Budget | $8.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 7.60% | Low — flag for Data Dive |
| Age | ~10 months (started 4/15/25) | — |

**Assessment:** ACoS and CVR are both healthy for a brand shield campaign. However, TOS IS at 7.6% is notably low — for a shield campaign whose job is to occupy branded search positions, this is a potential gap. Could indicate competitors are winning the top-of-search slot on cross stitch kit terms.

**Recommendation:** Check Data Dive to confirm rank trend on key branded/shield terms. If rank is stable, no action needed. If rank is slipping, raise bids slightly to push TOS IS higher.

### 2. shield product - latch hook kits — HEALTHY

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Brand Shield (product targeting, manual) | — |
| Spend | $74.41 (36.7% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 24.42% | Below 30% target |
| CVR | 13.64% (12/88) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $0.85 | — |
| CTR | 1.35% | — |
| Orders | 12 | — |
| Sales | $304.74 | — |
| Budget | $8.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 19.46% | Moderate — acceptable for product shield |
| Age | ~10 months (started 4/15/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Strong performance across the board. ACoS well below target, CVR above 10%, and consistent order volume. TOS IS at 19.46% is moderate — this campaign is defending latch hook kit placements effectively.

**Recommendation:** Maintain current bids. No changes needed. Monitor monthly for any ACoS drift.

### 3. shield brand name - manual and broad — TOP PERFORMER

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Brand Shield (brand name defense, manual/broad) | — |
| Spend | $31.73 (15.6% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 16.45% | Well below 30% target |
| CVR | 21.05% (8/38) | Well above 10% |
| CPC | $0.84 | — |
| CTR | 0.75% | — |
| Orders | 8 | — |
| Sales | $192.84 | — |
| Budget | $10.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | >95% | Excellent — dominant brand defense |
| Age | ~10 months (started 4/15/25) | — |

**Assessment:** This is the strongest campaign in the portfolio. >95% TOS IS means the brand name is almost completely defended at top-of-search. ACoS of 16.45% and CVR of 21.05% are outstanding for any campaign type, let alone brand defense. Low CTR (0.75%) is expected — shoppers searching the brand name are already high intent, fewer clicks but very high conversion.

**Recommendation:** Do not change anything. This campaign is performing exactly as intended. Maintain current bids and budget.

### 4. shield product - latch hook pillow — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Brand Shield (product targeting, manual) | — |
| Spend | $7.90 (3.9% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 19.77% | Below 30% target |
| CVR | 10.00% (1/10) | At 10% — insufficient sample |
| CPC | $0.79 | — |
| CTR | 1.28% | — |
| Orders | 1 | — |
| Sales | $39.96 | — |
| Budget | $10.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 22.08% | Moderate |
| Age | ~6 months (started 8/11/25) | — |

**Assessment:** ACoS looks good at 19.77%, but the sample is too small (10 clicks, 1 order) to draw confident conclusions. The campaign has a $10/day budget but is only spending $7.90 for the week — suggesting it may be under-bidding relative to the budget ceiling. Low impressions (784 vs. 6,500–7,000 for the other product shield campaigns) confirm this.

**Recommendation:** Consider raising bids slightly to generate more impressions and clicks. Need at least 30–50 clicks before CVR is statistically meaningful. Monitor for 2 more weeks before making any decisions based on ACoS.

## Dormant Campaigns (PAUSED — excluded from analysis)

The following campaigns are PAUSED and were excluded from analysis. No spend or activity in this data window.

| Campaign | Budget | Start Date | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|------------|----------------|
| shield product - bunny knitting | $2.00/day | 4/15/25 | Review: is this product line still active? If yes, evaluate whether shield coverage is needed |
| shield product - embroidery for kids | $1.00/day | 4/15/25 | Review: same question — active product line? |
| shield product - dessert sewing | $10.00/day | 4/15/25 | Budget is high for a paused campaign — archive or reduce budget if keeping paused |
| shield product - fairy sewing exact | $2.00/day | 4/14/25 | Review: active product? |
| shield product - mini fuse beads | $2.00/day | 4/14/25 | Review: active product? |
| shield product - cross and embroidery | $15.00/day | 10/9/25 | Highest budget of all paused campaigns — review intent and archive if no longer needed |
| shield product - cat knitting | $7.00/day | 10/9/25 | Review: active product? |

## Structure Check

> Note: Brand Shield portfolios operate under different structural expectations than standard performance portfolios. The structure below reflects Brand Shield norms, not the standard Auto/Broad/PAT/SK framework.

| Required Type | Present? | Campaign | Status |
|--------------|----------|----------|--------|
| Brand name defense | Yes | shield brand name - manual and broad | Healthy — >95% TOS IS |
| Product shield (cross stitch) | Yes | shield product - cross stitch kits | Watch — low TOS IS at 7.6% |
| Product shield (latch hook kits) | Yes | shield product - latch hook kits | Healthy |
| Product shield (latch hook pillow) | Yes | shield product - latch hook pillow | Watch — low data volume |
| Coverage for paused product lines | Paused | 7 campaigns paused | Review whether still needed |

**Gaps:** No structural gaps in active coverage. The main open question is whether the 7 paused campaigns represent product lines that still need shield protection. If those products are still selling, the shield gap could allow competitors to win those branded search positions.
