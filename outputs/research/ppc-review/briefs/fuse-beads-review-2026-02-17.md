# PPC Portfolio Review: Fuse Beads

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Data Window:** Last 7 days (excl. last 2 days)
**Portfolio Stage:** Growth — moderate order volume (70 orders), mix of campaign ages (2 months to 31 months old), multiple campaign types present, structure still building out

## Portfolio Overview

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Total Spend | $800.89 | — | — |
| Total Sales | $2,318.58 | — | — |
| Portfolio ACoS | 34.54% | ~35% (Growth) | OK — at target ceiling |
| Portfolio ROAS | 2.89 | — | — |
| Total Orders | 70 | — | — |
| Portfolio CVR | 8.23% (70/851) | 10% | Below Target |
| Active Campaigns | 12 (all with some spend) | — | — |

> **Note on CVR:** At 8.23%, portfolio conversion is below the 10% benchmark. This is the biggest structural risk. Low CVR inflates ACoS across the board — even campaigns with good targeting look expensive because the listing or price point may not be converting well enough. Check listing quality and main image before aggressively cutting bids.

## Action To-Do List

### P1 — Act Now (Highest Impact)

- [ ] **B07PXN4K8N 22000 beads LOW BID AUTO TOS**: Pause immediately — $30.82 spent, 0 orders, 0 sales. Auto campaign bleeding money with zero return. Either lower bids significantly and restructure, or pause until listing CVR improves.
- [ ] **mini fuse beads - SPM SK fuse bead kit TOS**: ACoS 51.62% with CVR only 6.52% — lower bids significantly across all ad groups. This SK TOS campaign is spending too much per click for what it converts. Reduce TOS% placement modifier as a first step.

### P2 — Investigate & Adjust

- [ ] **mini fuse beads TOS push - mini root**: ACoS 38.45%, CVR 7.69% — at the top of acceptable range but CVR is pulling ACoS up. Check search term report for irrelevant terms before lowering bids. Also check Data Dive for rank impact before cutting TOS spend.
- [ ] **mini fuse beads - SPM MK broad mini root**: ACoS 37.75%, CVR 9.33% — new campaign (started Dec 2025, ~10 weeks old). CVR is borderline, ACoS elevated. Monitor for another 2-3 weeks; if CVR doesn't reach 10%, reduce bids slightly. Do not cut aggressively yet — still maturing.
- [ ] **48 Minibeads - broad auto**: ACoS 36.74%, CVR 5.49% — oldest active campaign (Jul 2023, 31 months). Low CVR is the problem here, not bid level necessarily. Pull the search term report and remove irrelevant converting terms. If CVR doesn't improve after negation, lower bids slightly.
- [ ] **mini fuse beads TOS push - mini root other**: $2.74 spend, 0 orders, 5 clicks — very low activity. Either this campaign is under-bidding or targeting is wrong. Review targeting and either raise bids or evaluate if it's necessary given overlap with other TOS campaigns.

### P3 — Monitor / Scale

- [ ] **48 mini perler beads TOS push**: TOP PERFORMER — ACoS 16.50%, CVR 13.43%. Consider increasing daily budget from $7 (likely hitting cap). Check Data Dive for rank movement confirmation.
- [ ] **mini fuse beads- SPM MK multi root TOS**: ACoS 27.37%, CVR 11.96% — healthy and above CVR target. Maintain current bids. Check Data Dive for rank movement — this is a TOS campaign doing its job.
- [ ] **mini fuse beads - SPM MP product targeting**: ACoS 29.47%, CVR 13.51% — solid performer. Maintain. Could test a slight bid increase on best-converting targets.
- [ ] **mini fuse beads - SPM MK BROAD shinshin creation root**: ACoS 5.19% — extremely efficient but only 5 clicks total. Severely under-bidding or very low impression share. Raise bids to capture more volume from this audience. Treat as under-bidding flag.

### Structure Gaps

- [ ] **Auto campaign needs replacement or rehabilitation**: The only AUTOMATIC targeting campaign (B07PXN4K8N AUTO TOS) is non-functional. Once paused, either relaunch a proper auto campaign with competitive bids or ensure existing manual campaigns are capturing the discovery traffic.
- [ ] **TOS campaign consolidation review**: Four separate TOS-labelled campaigns exist with partially overlapping audiences. Evaluate whether "mini root", "mini root other", and "mini perler TOS push" serve distinct keyword sets or are cannibalizing each other.

## Campaign-by-Campaign Analysis

### 1. mini fuse beads TOS push - mini root — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | TOS Push (Manual) | — |
| Spend | $179.85 (22.46% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 38.45% | Above Growth target of ~35% |
| CVR | 7.69% (14/182) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.99 | — |
| CTR | 0.87% | — |
| Orders | 14 | — |
| Sales | $467.70 | — |
| Budget | $30.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 45.03% | Strong TOS presence |
| Age | ~12.5 months (started Jan 2025) | — |

**Assessment:** Largest spend campaign in the portfolio. ACoS is elevated because CVR is below benchmark — the clicks are coming in but not converting at target rate. TOS placement is strong at 45%, so rank signal is likely being sent, but the conversion gap is hurting ACoS.

**Recommendation:** Check Data Dive for rank movement before touching bids. Pull search term report — identify and negate irrelevant terms dragging CVR down. If rank is improving, tolerate current ACoS for now. If rank is flat, reduce TOS placement modifier by 10-15% to lower effective CPC.

### 2. mini fuse beads - SPM MK broad mini root — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | MK Broad | — |
| Spend | $174.78 (21.82% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 37.75% | Above Growth target of ~35% |
| CVR | 9.33% (14/150) | Borderline — just below 10% |
| CPC | $1.17 | — |
| CTR | 1.10% | — |
| Orders | 14 | — |
| Sales | $463.00 | — |
| Budget | $25.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 10.08% | Low TOS share |
| Age | ~2.5 months (started Dec 2025) | New campaign — evaluate primarily on CVR |

**Assessment:** New campaign still maturing (~10 weeks). CVR at 9.33% is close to target and trending well for its age. ACoS is above target but acceptable given the campaign is still establishing its keyword footprint. Highest CPC in the portfolio at $1.17 suggests competitive terms.

**Recommendation:** Do not cut bids yet — allow another 3-4 weeks to collect data. If CVR reaches 10%+, ACoS will likely land at or below target naturally. Monitor search term report weekly for negative additions.

### 3. 48 Minibeads - broad auto — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Broad (Manual — despite name) | — |
| Spend | $107.35 (13.40% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 36.74% | Above Growth target of ~35% |
| CVR | 5.49% (9/164) | Below 10% — significant gap |
| CPC | $0.65 | — |
| CTR | 0.68% | — |
| Orders | 9 | — |
| Sales | $292.20 | — |
| Budget | $16.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 5.62% | Minimal TOS presence |
| Age | ~31 months (started Jul 2023) | Established campaign |

**Assessment:** Oldest active campaign in the portfolio, but CVR at 5.49% is a serious concern. A campaign running 31 months with this low a conversion rate suggests keyword bloat — broad campaigns accumulate irrelevant search terms over time. This is the primary driver of inefficiency here, not bid level.

**Recommendation:** Pull the full search term report going back 30-60 days. Identify all converting terms and verify relevance. Add aggressive negatives for any terms with clicks but no orders. If CVR doesn't improve after negation cleanup, lower bids slightly. Consider whether this campaign is still necessary given the newer MK campaigns.

### 4. mini fuse beads - SPM SK fuse bead kit TOS — NEEDS ACTION (P1)

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Single Keyword (SK) + TOS | — |
| Spend | $104.20 (13.01% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 51.62% | Well above target — P1 |
| CVR | 6.52% (6/92) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $1.13 | — |
| CTR | 0.74% | — |
| Orders | 6 | — |
| Sales | $201.86 | — |
| Budget | $15.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 23.47% | Moderate TOS presence |
| Age | ~3 months (started Nov 2025) | Relatively new |

**Assessment:** ACoS at 51.62% with CVR at 6.52% is the worst efficiency combination in the portfolio. SK TOS campaigns are designed to push a single high-value keyword to top-of-search — but if CVR is low, each top-of-search click is extremely expensive. The keyword "fuse bead kit" may not be optimally converting for this listing.

**Recommendation:** Lower bids significantly on this campaign. Reduce the TOS placement modifier to bring effective CPC down. Evaluate whether "fuse bead kit" is the right keyword for this product's listing — check if the listing is optimized for this term. If rank is not improving (check Data Dive), this spend is not justified at current ACoS.

### 5. mini fuse beads- SPM MK multi root TOS — HEALTHY

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | MK + TOS Push | — |
| Spend | $98.02 (12.24% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 27.37% | Below Growth target of ~35% |
| CVR | 11.96% (11/92) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $1.07 | — |
| CTR | 7.29% | Strong CTR |
| Orders | 11 | — |
| Sales | $358.18 | — |
| Budget | $14.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 13.41% | Moderate TOS |
| Age | ~12.5 months (started Jan 2025) | Established |

**Assessment:** Strongest efficiency among the high-spend campaigns. CTR at 7.29% is notably high, suggesting very relevant keyword targeting. CVR above 10% and ACoS well within Growth target. This campaign is working.

**Recommendation:** Maintain current bids. Check Data Dive for rank movement — if this TOS campaign is driving organic rank improvement, it is delivering more value than ACoS alone shows. Budget at $14/day may be limiting — if it's hitting cap regularly, consider a small budget increase.

### 6. 48 mini perler beads tos push — TOP PERFORMER

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | TOS Push | — |
| Spend | $49.64 (6.20% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 16.50% | Well below target — excellent |
| CVR | 13.43% (9/67) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $0.74 | — |
| CTR | 4.16% | Good CTR |
| Orders | 9 | — |
| Sales | $300.78 | — |
| Budget | $7.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | TOS IS low despite TOS name |
| Age | ~14 months (started Dec 2024) | Established |

**Assessment:** Best performing campaign in the portfolio by ACoS. Low CPC, solid CVR, and meaningful order volume. Budget at $7/day is very likely capping this campaign and leaving sales on the table. Despite TOS IS being <5%, performance is strong — the campaign may be winning on other placements at very efficient rates.

**Recommendation:** Increase daily budget — consider doubling to $14-15/day. Check if the campaign is hitting its daily cap. This is the highest ROI campaign in the portfolio and is being underfunded relative to underperformers.

### 7. mini fuse beads - SPM MP product targeting — HEALTHY

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Product Targeting (PAT) | — |
| Spend | $49.19 (6.14% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 29.47% | Within Growth target of ~35% |
| CVR | 13.51% (5/37) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $1.33 | — |
| CTR | 5.31% | Good CTR |
| Orders | 5 | — |
| Sales | $166.90 | — |
| Budget | $7.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 53.61% | High TOS share for a PAT — unusual |
| Age | ~10 months (started Apr 2025) | Established |

**Assessment:** Solid product targeting campaign with good CVR and acceptable ACoS. The 53.61% TOS IS on a product targeting campaign is notably high — this suggests the ASIN targets or category targets may be appearing in TOS positions. Budget at $7/day may be capping this campaign too.

**Recommendation:** Maintain current bids. Consider a small budget increase if hitting daily cap. Monitor CPC — at $1.33 it's the highest CPC in the portfolio among healthy campaigns; a slight bid test downward could improve efficiency without sacrificing too many impressions.

### 8. B07PXN4K8N 22000 beads LOW BID AUTO TOS — FLAG (P1 URGENT)

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Auto (AUTOMATIC targeting) | — |
| Spend | $30.82 (3.85% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A — 0 orders | Undefined — money pit |
| CVR | 0% (0/55) | 0% — urgent |
| CPC | $0.56 | — |
| CTR | 5.88% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $35.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~23 months (started Mar 2024) | Long-running |

**Assessment:** This is the only automatic targeting campaign in the portfolio, and it is spending $30.82 with zero orders — a complete inefficiency. It has been running for 23 months, so this is not a new campaign finding its footing. Either the product it references (B07PXN4K8N — the 22,000 bead product) has a listing conversion problem, or the auto campaign is matching to irrelevant search terms. With 55 clicks and 0 conversions, something is fundamentally broken.

**Recommendation:** Pause this campaign immediately. The $35/day budget is being wasted. Before relaunching: check B07PXN4K8N listing quality, main image, and whether this ASIN is still active/winning the buy box. If the product and listing are healthy, relaunch a new auto campaign with a much lower starting bid and tighter budget cap ($5-8/day) while you identify which search terms convert.

### 9. mini fuse beads - SPM MK BROAD shinshin creation root — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | MK Broad | — |
| Spend | $3.53 (0.44% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 5.19% | Extremely efficient |
| CVR | 40% (2/5) | Above 10% — but very low sample size |
| CPC | $0.71 | — |
| CTR | 0.34% | Very low — under-bidding signal |
| Orders | 2 | — |
| Sales | $67.96 | — |
| Budget | $20.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~2.5 months (started Dec 2025) | New campaign |

**Assessment:** New campaign (2.5 months) with only 5 clicks and 2 orders. The 40% CVR and 5.19% ACoS look excellent but are not statistically meaningful at this sample size. The 0.34% CTR against a $20/day budget with only $3.53 spent strongly suggests this campaign is severely under-bidding — bids are too low to win impressions at meaningful volume.

**Recommendation:** Raise bids to generate more impressions and clicks. Target getting to at least 50-100 clicks before evaluating CVR and ACoS performance. The low CTR (0.34%) confirms the issue is not relevance — it's bid competitiveness.

### 10. mini fuse beads TOS push - mini root other — FLAG

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | TOS Push | — |
| Spend | $2.74 (0.34% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A — 0 orders | — |
| CVR | 0% (0/5) | — |
| CPC | $0.55 | — |
| CTR | 1.50% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $15.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~8.5 months (started May 2025) | Established enough to have data |

**Assessment:** This TOS push campaign is a sister to campaign #1 ("mini root") and targets a different keyword subset ("other"). With 8.5 months of runtime and only $2.74 spent this period, it is effectively dormant — either severely under-bidding or being completely outcompeted. Zero orders this period.

**Recommendation:** Review what keywords are in this campaign vs. the main "mini root" TOS. If there is overlap, consolidate. If targeting distinct terms, raise bids significantly. At current bid levels, this campaign is providing no value.

### 11. 48 mini beads - SP mini perler TOS push — FLAG (Near-Dormant)

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | TOS Push | — |
| Spend | $0.72 (0.09% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A — 0 orders | — |
| CVR | 0% (0/1) | — |
| CPC | $0.72 | — |
| CTR | 4.00% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $15.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 57.50% | High TOS IS — but only 1 click |
| Age | ~9 months (started May 2025) | Established |

**Assessment:** Near-dormant with only 25 impressions and 1 click this period. The 57.50% TOS IS on a single impression is not meaningful. This campaign has a $15/day budget but is barely spending — clear under-bidding situation for the "mini perler" keyword target.

**Recommendation:** Either raise bids to competitive levels (check what the manual "48 mini perler beads TOS push" in campaign #6 is bidding — this seems like a near-duplicate) or evaluate if this campaign is necessary. If campaign #6 covers "mini perler" keywords effectively, this one may be redundant and should be paused.

### 12. B07PXN4K8N 22000 beads LOW BID Product Targeting — FLAG (Near-Dormant)

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Product Targeting (PAT) | — |
| Spend | $0.05 (0.01% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A — 0 orders | — |
| CVR | 0% (0/1) | — |
| CPC | $0.05 | — |
| CTR | 4.55% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $10.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~23 months (started Mar 2024) | Long-running |

**Assessment:** Companion campaign to the dormant Auto campaign for the 22,000 bead product (B07PXN4K8N). $0.05 CPC is almost certainly below any competitive floor — the "LOW BID" in the name confirms this was intentionally set at very low bids. With 23 months of runtime and essentially zero activity, this campaign is not contributing to the portfolio.

**Recommendation:** Pause alongside the B07PXN4K8N Auto campaign. If the 22,000 bead product is worth advertising, create a new PAT campaign with market-rate bids. If the product is being discontinued or is low-priority, leave paused.

## Dormant Campaigns (ENABLED but minimal/no meaningful activity)

| Campaign | Spend | Budget | Start Date | Recommendation |
|----------|-------|--------|------------|----------------|
| mini fuse beads TOS push - mini root other | $2.74 | $15/day | May 2025 | Raise bids or consolidate with main TOS campaign |
| 48 mini beads - SP mini perler TOS push | $0.72 | $15/day | May 2025 | Evaluate overlap with campaign #6; raise bids or pause |
| B07PXN4K8N 22000 beads LOW BID AUTO TOS | $30.82 | $35/day | Mar 2024 | Pause immediately — 0 orders |
| B07PXN4K8N 22000 beads LOW BID Product Targeting | $0.05 | $10/day | Mar 2024 | Pause — companion to dead Auto campaign |

## Structure Check

| Required Type | Present? | Campaign | Status |
|--------------|----------|----------|--------|
| Auto | Yes | B07PXN4K8N 22000 beads LOW BID AUTO TOS | Needs work — 0 orders, needs pause and relaunch |
| Broad | Yes | 48 Minibeads - broad auto + SPM MK broad mini root | Functional — watch ACoS |
| Product Targeting | Yes | mini fuse beads - SPM MP product targeting | Healthy |
| Single Keyword | Yes | mini fuse beads - SPM SK fuse bead kit TOS | Needs work — ACoS 51.62% |
| TOS Push | Yes (multiple) | 4 TOS campaigns across portfolio | Partially healthy — consolidation review needed |
| Multi Keyword | Yes | SPM MK multi root TOS + SPM MK BROAD shinshin | Healthy |

**Gaps:**

- **Auto campaign is non-functional** — The only automatic targeting campaign has generated 0 orders across the data window. The portfolio currently lacks a working discovery/harvesting mechanism. Pause and relaunch with competitive bids.
- **TOS campaign proliferation** — Four separate TOS-labelled campaigns exist. Campaigns #1, #10, and #11 appear to target overlapping audiences ("mini root", "mini root other", "mini perler TOS push"). Review keyword lists for cannibalization before investing more in any TOS expansion.
- **No brand defense/shield campaign** — No brand keyword or brand shield campaign is visible. If competitors are bidding on your brand terms, this is unprotected spend leakage. Consider adding a branded keyword campaign (low budget, exact match) if not already in a separate portfolio.

---

## Summary

**What's working:**
- **48 mini perler beads TOS push** is the standout: 16.5% ACoS, 13.4% CVR, strong profitability — this campaign deserves more budget
- **SPM MK multi root TOS** is the best efficiency/volume combination among established campaigns: 27.4% ACoS, 12% CVR, strong CTR

**What needs attention:**
- **Portfolio CVR at 8.23% is the root problem** — before cutting bids broadly, audit the listing (main image, price, reviews) for the mini fuse beads product; if the listing doesn't convert, no bid adjustment will solve it
- **B07PXN4K8N campaigns (Auto + PAT) are dead weight** — $30.87 combined spend with 0 orders; these should be paused today

**Quick wins:**
1. **Pause B07PXN4K8N AUTO TOS** — immediate recovery of ~$30+/week in wasted spend
2. **Increase budget on "48 mini perler beads TOS push"** from $7/day to $14-15/day — fund your best performer before cutting underperformers

**Data Dive checks needed:**
- **mini fuse beads TOS push - mini root** — check organic rank movement for "mini root" keywords before adjusting TOS spend; 45% TOS IS is high and may be driving rank that isn't visible in ad metrics
- **mini fuse beads- SPM MK multi root TOS** — confirm rank improvement for multi root keywords; strong campaign metrics suggest rank signal is working
- **mini fuse beads - SPM SK fuse bead kit TOS** — verify whether "fuse bead kit" organic rank has moved despite poor ACoS; if rank is improving, the P1 action softens to P2
