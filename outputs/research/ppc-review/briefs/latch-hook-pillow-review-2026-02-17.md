## Action To-Do List

### P1 — Act Now (Highest Impact)

- [ ] **SPM product targeting**: Lower bids significantly — ACoS 65.92% with only 5.79% CVR. Targeting is pulling irrelevant traffic. Review search term report and cull non-converting ASINs. This campaign is burning 34% of portfolio budget with 17.7% of portfolio sales at nearly double target ACoS.
- [ ] **SPA auto**: Investigate urgently — $15.53 spend, 25 clicks, 0 orders in this window. Either bids are winning on irrelevant queries or attribution is delayed. Pull search term report. If pattern holds over 14 days, lower bids or pause.

### P2 — Investigate & Adjust

- [ ] **SPM latch hook kit root TOS**: $2.18 spend, 3 clicks, 0 orders over the data window. Running since 8/11/25 (6 months) with near-zero output. Either severely under-bidding or keyword is too competitive. Decide: raise bids to compete or pause and reallocate budget.
- [ ] **SPM hook rug kits for kids TOS**: $1.25 spend, 1 click, 0 orders. Same pattern — 6 months old, minimal activity. Evaluate keyword relevance. Raise bids or cut. Budget ($7/day) is sitting idle.

### P3 — Monitor / Scale

- [ ] **SPM broad**: ACoS 25.77%, CVR 12.62% — healthy performer. Consider modest budget increase ($20 → $25) to capture more volume.
- [ ] **SPM latch hook kit for kids TOS**: ACoS 25.30%, CVR 21.28%, TOS IS 30.13% — top performer. Check Data Dive for rank movement on "latch hook kit for kids." Protect this campaign's budget.
- [ ] **SB ai video**: ACoS 28.35%, CVR 11.76% — solid for a video format. Monitor DPV trend. No action needed.
- [ ] **SPM SK latch hook kits for beginners TOS**: New (started 1/21/26, ~4 weeks). ACoS 19.46%, CVR 25% — very promising early signals. Give it 4 more weeks before adjusting. Do not cut.
- [ ] **SPM other root TOS**: ACoS 8.39%, CVR 25%, ROAS 11.9x — standout efficiency. Only $2/day budget. Consider increasing budget — this is the most efficient campaign in the portfolio.

### Structure Gaps

- [ ] **Auto campaign is under-resourced**: $3/day budget is very low. If SPA auto recovers after search term review, consider increasing budget to $5–7/day to improve keyword discovery.
- [ ] **No dedicated MK (multi-keyword) campaign confirmed**: SPM broad appears to serve this role. Verify if a true MK campaign is needed or if broad covers it adequately.

## Campaign-by-Campaign Analysis

### 1. latch hook pillow - SPM product targeting — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Product Targeting (PAT) | — |
| Spend | $115.27 (34.18% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 65.92% | Well Above 35% target |
| CVR | 5.79% (7 orders / 121 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.95 | — |
| CTR | 1.46% | — |
| Orders | 7 | — |
| Sales | $174.86 | — |
| Budget | $18.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 18.12% | — |
| Age | ~4 months (started 10/15/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Largest spend campaign by far but delivering the worst ACoS in the portfolio at 65.92% — nearly double the Growth stage target. Low CVR (5.79%) indicates the product targets being served are not well-matched to buyer intent. At this spend rate, this campaign is the single biggest drag on portfolio profitability.

**Recommendation:** Pull the search term report immediately. Identify which ASIN targets are spending without converting and negate or remove them. Lower overall bids by 20-30% until ACoS comes down toward 35-40%. Do not pause outright yet — some converting targets may be worth salvaging. Revisit in 7 days.

### 2. latch hook pillow - SPM broad — HEALTHY

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Broad (SPM Broad) | — |
| Spend | $83.67 (24.81% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 25.77% | Below 35% target |
| CVR | 12.62% (13 orders / 103 clicks) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $0.81 | — |
| CTR | 0.55% | — |

| Budget | $20.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 5.96% | — |
| Age | ~6 months (started 8/11/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Portfolio workhorse. Highest order count (13), healthy ACoS well under target, CVR above benchmark. CTR is low (0.55%) which is expected for broad match. This campaign is consistently contributing.

**Recommendation:** Maintain current bids. Consider a modest budget increase to $25/day to test volume capacity. Continue harvesting search terms to feed SK campaigns.

### 3. latch hook pillow - SPM latch hook kit for kids TOS — TOP PERFORMER

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | TOS (Single Keyword) | — |
| Spend | $60.66 (17.99% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 25.30% | Below 35% target |
| CVR | 21.28% (10 orders / 47 clicks) | Well Above 10% |
| CPC | $1.29 | — |
| CTR | 5.37% | — |
| Orders | 10 | — |
| Sales | $239.80 | — |
| Budget | $10.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 30.13% | — |
| Age | ~6 months (started 8/11/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Standout performer. CVR of 21.28% is exceptional. CTR of 5.37% confirms strong listing-keyword alignment. TOS IS of 30.13% suggests solid rank position on "latch hook kit for kids." ACoS well within target for Growth stage.

**Recommendation:** Protect this campaign's budget — do not reduce. Check Data Dive for organic rank movement on "latch hook kit for kids." If rank is improving, maintain or modestly increase bids to push TOS IS higher. Consider a budget increase to $12-15/day if it's hitting the cap.

### 4. latch hook pillow - SB ai video — HEALTHY

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Video (SB2) | — |
| Spend | $49.58 (14.71% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 28.35% | Below 35% target |
| CVR | 11.76% (6 orders / 51 clicks) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $0.97 | — |
| CTR | 1.65% | — |
| Orders | 6 | — |
| Sales | $174.86 | — |
| Budget | $7.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 24.84% | — |
| NTB Orders | 6 (100% NTB) | — |
| Age | ~3.5 months (started 11/6/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Strong video campaign. 100% NTB (new-to-brand) orders means this campaign is purely acquiring new customers, which is valuable at Growth stage. ACoS is healthy and CVR is solid for SB format. DPV of 134 shows good brand discovery traffic beyond just clicks.

**Recommendation:** Maintain current spend. Monitor DPV trend — increasing DPV over time is a positive leading indicator. No changes needed this cycle.

### 5. latch hook pillow - SPA auto — FLAG

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Auto (SPA) | — |
| Spend | $15.53 (4.61% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | — |
| CVR | 0% (0 orders / 25 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.62 | — |
| CTR | 4.98% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $3.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~6 months (started 8/11/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Auto campaign with $15.53 spend and 0 orders is a concern. CTR of 4.98% is surprisingly healthy, suggesting clicks are happening on relevant queries — but none are converting. This could be attribution lag, a listing issue on the landing page, or genuinely poor match. The $3/day budget means it's not bleeding heavily, but 0 orders over a full 7-day window on an established campaign needs investigation.

**Recommendation:** Pull the search term report. Check if queries match the product. If matches look relevant, the issue may be listing conversion — check main image, price, and reviews against competitors. If queries are irrelevant, add negatives and lower bids. Do not pause yet — gather data first.

### 6. latch hook pillow - SPM SK latch hook kits for beginners TOS — WATCH (Promising New)

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | TOS (Single Keyword) | — |
| Spend | $4.86 (1.44% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 19.46% | Below 35% target |
| CVR | 25.00% (1 order / 4 clicks) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $1.21 | — |
| CTR | 3.36% | — |
| Orders | 1 | — |
| Sales | $24.98 | — |
| Budget | $13.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 31.11% | — |
| Age | ~4 weeks (started 1/21/26) — NEW |

**Assessment:** Very early data — only 4 clicks and 1 order. Numbers look promising (25% CVR, 19.46% ACoS, 31.11% TOS IS) but sample size is too small to draw conclusions. Flagged as experimental — needs more data. Budget of $13/day is significantly underutilized given low activity.

**Recommendation:** Do not adjust bids yet. Give this campaign 4 more weeks to accumulate data. If CPC bids are not winning impressions (only 119 over 4 weeks), consider modestly raising bids to compete for the TOS slot. Revisit at 8-week mark.

### 7. latch hook pillow - SPM other root TOS — TOP PERFORMER

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | TOS (Multi-target/Root) | — |
| Spend | $4.19 (1.24% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 8.39% | Well Below 35% target |
| CVR | 25.00% (2 orders / 8 clicks) | Well Above 10% |
| CPC | $0.52 | — |
| CTR | 1.00% | — |
| Orders | 2 | — |
| Sales | $49.96 | — |
| Budget | $2.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~6 months (started 8/11/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Most efficient campaign in the portfolio by ROAS (11.92x) and ACoS (8.39%). Generating $49.96 sales on $4.19 spend. The $2/day budget cap is almost certainly limiting this campaign's volume — it is likely hitting the cap daily.

**Recommendation:** Increase budget immediately to $5–7/day. This is the clearest quick win in the portfolio. TOS IS is low (<5%) despite strong CVR, suggesting bids may need a moderate raise to capture more impressions at top of search.

### 8. latch hook pillow - SPM latch hook kit root TOS — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | TOS (Root keyword) | — |
| Spend | $2.18 (0.65% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | — |
| CVR | 0% (0 orders / 3 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.73 | — |
| CTR | 0.57% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $4.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~6 months (started 8/11/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Running for 6 months with near-zero activity (only 3 clicks, 0 orders in this window, $2.18 spend vs. $4/day budget). Either bids are too low to win impressions consistently, or the keyword "latch hook kit root" has low search volume. This campaign is essentially a dead campaign.

**Recommendation:** Decision point — either raise bids significantly to compete and test for 2 more weeks, or pause and reallocate the $4/day budget to the high-performing "other root TOS" campaign. If keyword research shows this term has volume, revive it. If not, cut it.

### 9. latch hook pillow - SPM hook rug kits for kids TOS — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | TOS (Single Keyword) | — |
| Spend | $1.25 (0.37% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | — |
| CVR | 0% (0 orders / 1 click) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $1.25 | — |
| CTR | 0.83% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $7.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 30.65% | — |
| Age | ~6 months (started 8/11/25) | — |

**Assessment:** TOS IS of 30.65% shows this campaign IS winning top-of-search impressions on "hook rug kits for kids" — but only 121 impressions and 1 click over the data window. Extremely low volume keyword. Despite achieving TOS placement, the search term generates almost no traffic. Budget of $7/day is virtually unused.

**Recommendation:** Check keyword search volume in Data Dive. If the keyword has very low monthly search volume, pause and redirect the $7/day budget to higher-volume performers. If volume exists but is seasonal, monitor. Do not leave $7/day budget sitting idle indefinitely.

## Dormant Campaigns (ENABLED but no activity)

| Campaign | Budget | Start Date | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|------------|----------------|
| latch hook pillow - SPM latch hook pillow kit TOS | $4.00/day | 8/11/25 | 97 impressions, 0 clicks — bids too low to drive clicks or keyword has no volume. Check search volume, raise bids to test, or pause. |
| latch pillow - SPM SK latch hook rug kits for kids TOS | $15.00/day | 1/11/26 | New campaign (~5 weeks) but only 5 impressions and 0 clicks. Bids are almost certainly too low. Raise bids to compete for TOS placement. Urgent given $15/day budget going to waste. |

## Structure Check

| Required Type | Present? | Campaign | Status |
|--------------|----------|----------|--------|
| Auto | Yes | latch hook pillow - SPA auto | Needs work — 0 orders, investigate |
| Broad | Yes | latch hook pillow - SPM broad | Healthy |
| Product Targeting (PAT) | Yes | latch hook pillow - SPM product targeting | Needs work — ACoS 65.92% |
| Single Keyword TOS | Yes | Multiple SK TOS campaigns | Mixed — 2 healthy, 2 struggling |
| Video / SB | Yes | latch hook pillow - SB ai video | Healthy |
| Multi Keyword (MK) | Unclear | SPM broad may serve this role | Verify if dedicated MK campaign is needed |

**Gaps:**
- No confirmed standalone MK campaign — SPM broad may be filling this role, but if SOP requires a dedicated MK, consider creating one as portfolio matures
- Auto campaign ($3/day) is significantly under-resourced for a 6-month-old portfolio — consider increasing to $5-7/day once search terms are cleaned up
- Two dormant SK campaigns wasting budget that could be redirected to performers

---

## Summary

**What's working:**
- SPM broad and SPM latch hook kit for kids TOS are the backbone of portfolio performance — together they account for 13 of the top 23 orders at healthy ACoS
- SB ai video is generating 100% NTB orders at efficient ACoS — strong brand acquisition engine for Growth stage
- SPM other root TOS is the most efficient campaign (ROAS 11.9x) and needs its budget raised immediately

**What needs attention:**
- SPM product targeting is the single biggest problem — consuming 34% of spend at 65.92% ACoS. Fixing this campaign alone would dramatically improve portfolio ACoS
- SPA auto has 0 orders on $15+ spend — needs search term audit to determine if this is attribution lag, relevance issue, or listing conversion problem

**Quick wins:**
- Increase SPM other root TOS budget from $2/day to $6/day — highest ROAS, currently budget-capped
- Raise bids on "latch pillow - SPM SK latch hook rug kits for kids TOS" — $15/day budget with 0 clicks means bids are not competing; fix or pause

**Data Dive checks needed:**
- SPM latch hook kit for kids TOS — verify organic rank movement on "latch hook kit for kids" before any bid changes
- SPM other root TOS — verify what root keyword is triggering and check rank trend
- SPM hook rug kits for kids TOS — verify monthly search volume before deciding to cut or revive
- SPM latch hook kit root TOS — verify search volume and rank to decide revive vs. cut
