## Portfolio Overview

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Total Spend | $161.05 | — | — |
| Total Sales | $401.60 | — | — |
| Portfolio ACoS | 40.10% | ~35% | Above Target |
| Portfolio ROAS | 2.49x | — | — |
| Total Orders | 20 | — | — |
| Portfolio CVR | 8.44% | 10% | Below Target |
| Active Campaigns (with data) | 5 | — | — |
| Dormant Campaigns (ENABLED, no activity) | 2 | — | — |

**Stage note:** Growth stage. The portfolio has a mix of campaigns running ~6 months (since Aug 2025) and one newer campaign (Jan 2026). At 20 orders/week, this sits right at the Launch/Growth boundary — the priority is improving CVR to 10%+ while bringing ACoS toward the 35% target.

## Action To-Do List

### P1 — Act Now (Highest Impact)

- [ ] **SPM Broad and Phrase** ($74.20 spend, 46% of budget): ACoS 53% with only 6.86% CVR — lower bids significantly across all keywords. This single campaign is the biggest driver of portfolio ACoS being above target. Pull the search term report and identify and negate any irrelevant terms.
- [ ] **MK cross stitch root TOS** ($10.72 spend, 0 orders): Actively bleeding spend with zero return. Lower bids significantly or pause immediately. Check search terms — if terms are relevant, lower bids and monitor. If irrelevant, pause.
- [ ] **SK beginner cross stitch kits for kids TOS** ($18.54 spend, 3.70% CVR, 92.79% ACoS): New campaign (~6 weeks old) but CVR is critically low at 3.70%. Lower bids and check search term relevance. At this CVR level, more impressions will not fix the problem — the keyword match may be too broad or the product-keyword fit is weak.

### P2 — Investigate & Adjust

- [ ] **MK embroidery root TOS** (DORMANT, ENABLED): Campaign is live but generated zero impressions this week. Either bids are too low or the budget is competing internally. Review bids and check for budget cannibalization from other TOS campaigns.
- [ ] **SK embroidery kit for kids TOS** (DORMANT, ENABLED): Same issue — zero impressions despite being ENABLED since Aug 2025. This campaign has been dormant for an extended period. Check bids urgently; if unresponsive to bid increases, consider pausing.

### P3 — Monitor / Scale

- [ ] **SK cross stitch kits for kids TOS** (ACoS 18.62%, CVR 23.08%): Top performer in the portfolio — but TOS IS is <5%, which is very low for a TOS campaign. Consider increasing bids to capture more top-of-search share. Check Data Dive to confirm if this keyword is driving rank movement.
- [ ] **SPA Auto** (ACoS 29.11%, CVR 8.82%): Performing close to target. Monitor. If CVR reaches 10%+, consider allowing budget to flex higher to feed learnings into SK campaigns.

### Structure Gaps

- [ ] **Product Targeting (PAT) campaign is PAUSED**: SOP requires an active PAT campaign. Evaluate whether to reactivate the large-kit PAT (`cross embroidery - both SPM product targeting`) or create a new small-kit-focused PAT. PAT campaigns help defend against competitor conquesting and target adjacent ASINs.

## Campaign-by-Campaign Analysis

### 1. cross embroidery - small kit SPM broad and phrase — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Broad (SPM) | — |
| Spend | $74.20 (46.1% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 53.05% | Well Above 35% target |
| CVR | 6.86% (7 orders / 102 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.73 | — |
| CTR | 7.40% | — |
| Orders | 7 | — |
| Sales | $139.86 | — |
| Budget | $14.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 19.21% | — |
| Age | ~6 months (started 8/12/25) | — |

**Assessment:** This campaign accounts for nearly half the portfolio's spend and is the primary reason ACoS is above target. At 53% ACoS with only 6.86% CVR, both the cost per click and the conversion rate are working against this campaign. After 6 months, this is not a data problem — the bids are too high for current conversion performance.

**Recommendation:** Pull the search term report. Negate irrelevant terms immediately. Lower bids across the ad group — target a CPC reduction that would bring estimated ACoS into the 35-40% range given current CVR. Do not pause yet — this campaign is generating 7 of the portfolio's 20 orders, but it needs a significant bid reduction to become efficient.

### 2. cross embroidery - small kit SPA auto — HEALTHY

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Auto (SPA) | — |
| Spend | $34.90 (21.7% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 29.11% | Below 35% target |
| CVR | 8.82% (6 orders / 68 clicks) | Slightly Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.51 | — |
| CTR | 4.36% | — |
| Orders | 6 | — |
| Sales | $119.88 | — |
| Budget | $15.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~6 months (started 8/12/25) | — |

**Assessment:** The auto campaign is the healthiest in the portfolio — ACoS is under target and it is delivering 6 orders at an efficient cost. CVR of 8.82% is close to the 10% goal. This campaign is doing its job of discovering converting search terms that can be harvested into manual campaigns.

**Recommendation:** Maintain current bids. Harvest any high-CVR search terms from this campaign's search term report and push them into SK TOS campaigns. If CVR climbs to 10%+, consider modestly increasing budget to accelerate learnings.

### 3. cross embroidery - small kit SPM SK cross stitch kits for kids TOS — TOP PERFORMER

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Single Keyword / TOS (SPM SK) | — |
| Spend | $22.69 (14.1% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 18.62% | Well Below 35% target |
| CVR | 23.08% (6 orders / 26 clicks) | Well Above 10% |
| CPC | $0.87 | — |
| CTR | 1.57% | — |
| Orders | 6 | — |
| Sales | $121.88 | — |
| Budget | $24.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | Low for a TOS campaign |
| Age | ~6 months (started 8/12/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Best performing campaign in the portfolio by ACoS and CVR — 23% CVR and 18.62% ACoS is excellent. However, TOS Impression Share is below 5%, which is low for a campaign specifically designed to win top-of-search placements. This campaign is underexposed — it is converting well when it shows but is not showing enough.

**Recommendation:** Increase bids to capture more TOS impression share. This campaign is the portfolio's most efficient converter and deserves more of the budget. Check Data Dive to confirm whether this keyword is moving organic rank — if so, this is a high-value scaling opportunity. Do not cut; scale carefully.

### 4. cross embroidery - small kit SPM SK beginner cross stitch kits for kids TOS — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Single Keyword / TOS (SPM SK) — New Campaign | — |
| Spend | $18.54 (11.5% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 92.79% | Well Above 35% target |
| CVR | 3.70% (1 order / 27 clicks) | Well Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.69 | — |
| CTR | 1.04% | — |
| Orders | 1 | — |
| Sales | $19.98 | — |
| Budget | $20.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 38.93% | High TOS share |
| Age | ~6 weeks (started 1/7/26) — New Campaign | — |

**Assessment:** This campaign is new (~6 weeks old), so some tolerance for higher ACoS applies — but CVR of 3.70% is a red flag that goes beyond newness. It has strong TOS impression share (38.93%), meaning it is showing up at the top frequently, but only converting 3.7% of clicks. The keyword "beginner cross stitch kits for kids" may be attracting browsers rather than buyers, or the landing page/product fit is weak for this specific search intent. The campaign is spending $18.54 for a single $19.98 order.

**Recommendation:** Lower bids to reduce spend while CVR remains this low. Pull the search term report to verify what exact queries are triggering this campaign — if terms are off-target, add negatives. Give it 2 more weeks after bid adjustment. If CVR does not reach at least 7-8% by then, consider pausing and revisiting the keyword strategy.

### 5. cross embroidery - small kit SPM MK cross stitch root TOS — FLAG

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Multi-Keyword / TOS (SPM MK) | — |
| Spend | $10.72 (6.7% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 0% (no orders) | N/A — no return |
| CVR | 0% (0 orders / 14 clicks) | Well Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.77 | — |
| CTR | 5.17% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $25.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 35.90% | High TOS share |
| Age | ~6 months (started 8/12/25) | — |

**Assessment:** This campaign has strong TOS impression share (35.90%) and acceptable CTR (5.17%), but zero orders on $10.72 spend this week. After 6 months, zero conversions in a week is a performance signal — not just a data lag issue. The campaign is reaching top-of-search placements but not converting. Either the keywords are attracting the wrong audience or there is a product-keyword mismatch for these root terms.

**Recommendation:** Lower bids significantly to halt the spend bleed while you investigate. Pull the search term report immediately — identify whether terms triggering this campaign are commercially relevant. If terms are irrelevant, add negatives and lower bids. If terms seem relevant but still not converting, this may be a product page issue (images, price, reviews) rather than a PPC issue.

## Dormant Campaigns (ENABLED but no activity this week)

| Campaign | Budget | Start Date | Issue | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|------------|-------|----------------|
| cross embroidery - small kit SPM SK embroidery kit for kids TOS | $15.00/day | 8/12/25 | 0 impressions, 0 spend — been live ~6 months | Check bids urgently. If bids are competitive and still no impressions, consider pausing. This has been dormant too long to leave as-is. |
| cross embroidery - small kit SPM MK embroidery root TOS | $15.00/day | 8/12/25 | 0 impressions, 0 spend — been live ~6 months | Check bids. May be losing budget internally to other TOS campaigns. If bids are already competitive, pause and reallocate budget to SK cross stitch TOS which is converting. |

## Structure Check

| Required Type | Present? | Campaign | Status |
|--------------|----------|----------|--------|
| Auto | Yes | cross embroidery - small kit SPA auto | Healthy — ACoS 29%, monitor |
| Broad | Yes | cross embroidery - small kit SPM broad and phrase | Needs work — ACoS 53%, bids too high |
| Product Targeting (PAT) | No | All PAT campaigns are PAUSED | GAP — no active PAT coverage |
| Single Keyword (TOS) | Yes | SK cross stitch kits for kids TOS | Healthy — top performer, scale |
| Single Keyword (TOS) | Yes | SK beginner cross stitch kits for kids TOS | Needs work — new, low CVR |
| Multi-Keyword (TOS) | Yes | MK cross stitch root TOS | Flagged — 0 orders, spending |
| Multi-Keyword (TOS) | Yes | MK embroidery root TOS | Dormant — 0 impressions |

**Gaps:**

- **Product Targeting (PAT) — Missing from active campaigns.** The only PAT campaign (`cross embroidery - both SPM product targeting`) is PAUSED. At Growth stage, an active PAT campaign is important for defending against competitor conquesting and targeting complementary/adjacent ASINs. Recommend either reactivating the existing campaign or creating a new small-kit-focused PAT with 3-5 targeted ASINs and 2 keyword ad groups.
- **Embroidery root keywords underperforming.** Both embroidery-themed campaigns (MK embroidery root TOS and SK embroidery kit for kids TOS) are dormant or underperforming. "Cross stitch" terms are outperforming "embroidery" terms significantly — this may reflect actual customer search behavior. Worth validating in Data Dive whether "embroidery" drives meaningful volume for this product.

## Summary

**What's working:**
- `SK cross stitch kits for kids TOS` is the portfolio standout — 23% CVR, 18.62% ACoS, 6 orders. This keyword converts. Scale it.
- `SPA Auto` is healthy and efficient at 29.11% ACoS — a reliable order source and good signal generator for the rest of the portfolio.

**What needs attention:**
- `SPM Broad and Phrase` is consuming 46% of the portfolio budget at 53% ACoS — this single campaign is the primary driver of above-target portfolio ACoS. Bid reductions here will have the biggest impact on overall efficiency.
- `MK cross stitch root TOS` is spending $10.72/week with zero orders after 6 months — this is an active bleed that needs to stop until the search term issue is diagnosed.

**Quick wins:**
1. Lower bids on SPM Broad significantly (target: reduce spend by 20-30% while maintaining order volume). This alone could bring portfolio ACoS from 40% toward 35%.
2. Increase bids on `SK cross stitch kits for kids TOS` to capture more TOS impression share — it converts at 23% and is currently under-exposed (<5% TOS IS).

**Data Dive checks needed:**
- `SK cross stitch kits for kids TOS` — verify if this keyword is driving organic rank movement. If yes, this is a strategic spend worth scaling aggressively.
- `SK beginner cross stitch kits for kids TOS` — check if "beginner" modifier is changing search intent in a way that reduces purchase intent.
- `MK cross stitch root TOS` — confirm whether root terms (without "for kids") are relevant to this product's buyer profile.
- Dormant embroidery campaigns — check Data Dive search volume for "embroidery kit for kids" vs. "cross stitch kits for kids" to determine if embroidery terms are worth reviving or should be deprioritized.
