## Account Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Account Spend | $5,448.99 |
| Total Account Sales | $16,053.18 |
| Account ACoS | 33.94% |
| Account ROAS | 2.95 |
| Total Orders | 642 |

| Account CVR | 8.10% |
| Active Portfolios | 17 |
| Catch-All Portfolios | 1 (.Catch All Auto) |
| Shield Portfolios | 1 (Shield All) |

**Account-Level Assessment:** Account ACoS of 33.94% is above the 30% optimization target. CVR of 8.10% is below the 10% threshold. Four portfolios have ACoS above 50% — these are the primary drag on account efficiency. The catch-all and shield portfolios are performing well (22-24% ACoS), which is a positive sign.

## Account Health Assessment

### Portfolio Stage Distribution

| Stage | Count | Portfolios |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Launch | 3 | princess lacing cards, Needlepoint, 4 Flowers embroidery |
| Growth | 3 | Latch Hook Pillow, Cat And Hat Knitting, Cross And Embroidery Kits |
| Optimization | 3 | fairy family, Embroidery for kids, Latch hook kits |
| Maintenance | 3 | fuse beads, Cross stitch backpack charms, biggie beads |
| Special (Catch-all) | 1 | .Catch All Auto |
| Special (Shield) | 1 | Shield All |
| Not reviewed | 3 | Dessert Family, punch needle Plush heart, Stitch Dictionary All |

### ACoS Distribution

| Range | Count | Portfolios |
|-------|-------|------------|
| < 25% (Excellent) | 3 | biggie beads (22.26%), .Catch All Auto (22.31%), Shield All (24.01%) |
| 25-35% (Healthy) | 6 | Cat And Hat Knitting (30.07%), punch needle (31.93%), Latch hook kits (32.78%), Cross stitch backpack (33.28%), Latch Hook Pillow (34.09%), fuse beads (34.54%) |
| 35-50% (Above Target) | 3 | fairy family (37.63%), Cross And Embroidery Kits (40.10%), Embroidery for kids (40.90%) |
| > 50% (Red Flag) | 4 | princess lacing cards (53.77%), Dessert Family (64.38%), 4 Flowers embroidery (74.74%), Needlepoint (81.26%) |

### Budget Concentration

| Top 3 Portfolios | Spend | % of Total |
|-------------------|-------|------------|
| .Catch All Auto | $861.51 | 15.81% |
| fuse beads | $800.89 | 14.70% |
| fairy family | $584.75 | 10.73% |
| **Top 3 Total** | **$2,247.15** | **41.24%** |

**Concentration Risk:** Moderate — the top 3 portfolios consume 41% of total spend. The Catch All Auto is the largest spender but also the most efficient (22.31% ACoS), so that concentration is healthy. The bigger concern is that four Red Flag portfolios (princess lacing, Dessert Family, 4 Flowers, Needlepoint) collectively spend $1,057.72 (19.4% of total) at a combined ACoS of ~66%, dragging the account average up significantly.

| 14 | 4 Flowers embroidery | Shield brand self target ($48.22, 193.03% ACoS) | Investigate — brand shield shouldn't be this expensive. Check targeting | $48.22 |

| ROAS | 4.48 | — |
| Orders | 159 | Highest volume |
| Stage | Catch-all (special rules) | — |
| P1 Actions | 0 | — |

**Key Issue:** None — performing well within catch-all thresholds (20-25% ACoS target)
**Quick Win:** Monitor Catch All - Auto - 0.15 campaign ($4.46 spend, 4 orders, 4.38% ACoS) — potential to scale this tier

| Stage | Maintenance | — |
| P1 Actions | 1 (SK fuse bead kit TOS) | — |

**Key Issue:** SK fuse bead kit TOS campaign spending $104.20 at 51.62% ACoS — needs bid reduction. Also B07PXN4K8N 22000 beads LOW BID AUTO TOS spent $30.82 with 0 orders.
**Quick Win:** Lower bids on SK fuse bead kit TOS — check Data Dive first for rank movement

---

### 3. fairy family — NEEDS ATTENTION

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Spend | $584.75 (10.73% of account) | — |
| ACoS | 37.63% | Above 30% target |
| ROAS | 2.66 | — |
| Orders | 66 | — |
| Stage | Optimization | — |
| P1 Actions | 2 (Broad, SK sewing for kids TOS) | — |

**Key Issue:** Main broad campaign ($245.91) at 47.31% ACoS is dragging the portfolio. SK sewing for kids TOS has 86.77% ACoS (1 order). Product targeting is OUT_OF_BUDGET and burning at 43.54% ACoS.
**Quick Win:** Lower bids on the broad campaign — it's the biggest lever (42% of portfolio spend)

---

### 4. Cross stitch backpack charms — WATCH

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Spend | $529.48 (9.72% of account) | — |
| ACoS | 33.28% | Slightly above 30% target |
| ROAS | 3.00 | — |
| Orders | 72 | — |
| Stage | Maintenance | — |
| P1 Actions | See separate review (2026-02-16) | — |

**Key Issue:** Reviewed yesterday — Broad 2 campaign ($245.14, 42.87% ACoS) and SK TOS ($41.52, 69.27% ACoS) flagged as P1
**Quick Win:** See `cross-girl-review-2026-02-16.md` for detailed action items

### 5. 4 Flowers embroidery — RED FLAG

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Spend | $415.98 (7.63% of account) | — |
| ACoS | 74.74% | Nearly 2.5x above target |
| ROAS | 1.34 | — |
| Orders | 23 | — |
| Stage | Launch | — |
| P1 Actions | 4+ (multiple zero-order campaigns) | — |

**Key Issue:** This is the most problematic portfolio in the account. ACoS of 74.74% means $3 of ad spend for every $4 of sales. Multiple campaigns with 0 orders: SK embroidery for beginners TOS ($54.51), shield brand self target ($48.22 at 193% ACoS), SO|PT ($33.33 at 133% ACoS). Even accounting for Launch stage tolerance, this is bleeding money.
**Quick Win:** Pause or significantly lower bids on all campaigns with 0 orders + spend > $10. Focus remaining budget on the 2 campaigns that actually convert.

---

### 6. princess lacing cards — RED FLAG (Launch)

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Spend | $408.22 (7.49% of account) | — |
| ACoS | 53.77% | High, but Launch stage |
| ROAS | 1.86 | — |
| Orders | 38 | Decent for launch |
| Stage | Launch | — |
| P1 Actions | 2 (Broad TOS, PAT) | — |

**Key Issue:** As a Launch portfolio, some ACoS tolerance is warranted, but 53.77% is still very high. The MK broad TOS ($185.16, 61.78% ACoS) and PAT ($103.33, 64.65% ACoS) are the main drains. CVR is 11.21% on the auto campaign which is a positive signal — the product converts.
**Quick Win:** Lower bids on MK broad TOS and PAT — but check Data Dive for rank movement before cutting aggressively since this is a launch product

---

### 7. Embroidery for kids — NEEDS ATTENTION

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Spend | $369.02 (6.77% of account) | — |
| ACoS | 40.90% | Above 30% target |
| ROAS | 2.45 | — |
| Orders | 35 | — |
| Stage | Optimization | — |
| P1 Actions | 1 (Broad TOS borderline) | — |

**Key Issue:** Broad TOS is the highest spender ($140.99, 38.76% ACoS) — above target but has 14 orders showing good targeting. The SK embroidery kit for beginners ($64.65, 36.97% ACoS) and video ad ($62.06, 34.13% ACoS) are also slightly above target. Several low-activity campaigns with 0 orders.
**Quick Win:** Minor bid reduction on the broad TOS campaign and investigate the MK needlepoint root TOS ($20.88, 0 orders)

---

### 8. Latch Hook Pillow — WATCH

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Spend | $337.19 (6.19% of account) | — |
| ACoS | 34.09% | Slightly above target |
| ROAS | 2.93 | — |
| Orders | 39 | — |
| Stage | Growth | — |
| P1 Actions | 1 (Product targeting) | — |

**Key Issue:** Product targeting campaign ($115.27, 65.92% ACoS) is the main issue — 7 orders but terrible efficiency. The broad ($83.67, 25.77% ACoS) and TOS ($60.66, 25.30% ACoS) are actually performing well. Auto has 0 orders at $15.53 spend.
**Quick Win:** Lower bids on product targeting significantly. Consider scaling the TOS campaign which has strong performance.

---

### 9. Cat And Hat Knitting — WATCH

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Spend | $247.27 (4.54% of account) | — |
| ACoS | 30.07% | At target |
| ROAS | 3.33 | — |
| Orders | 26 | — |
| Stage | Growth | — |
| P1 Actions | 2 (Broad, SK loom knitting TOS) | — |

**Key Issue:** Portfolio ACoS is right at target, but two campaigns are pulling it down: broad ($87.75, 56.29% ACoS) and SK loom knitting kit TOS ($49.82, 184.66% ACoS — 1 order). Meanwhile, the auto campaign is a hidden gem ($31.61, 6.95% ACoS, 12 orders).
**Quick Win:** Scale the auto campaign (increase budget from $6 to $10-12). Lower bids significantly on broad and SK loom knitting TOS.

---

### 10. Shield All — HEALTHY

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Spend | $202.98 (3.73% of account) | — |
| ACoS | 24.01% | Good for shield |
| ROAS | 4.16 | — |
| Orders | 33 | — |
| Stage | Shield (special) | — |
| P1 Actions | 0 | — |

**Key Issue:** None — shield portfolio is performing its defensive role well. Brand name campaign at $31.73 with 16.45% ACoS is excellent.
**Quick Win:** Monitor shield brand asins campaign ($18.84, 0 orders) — may need targeting review

---

### 11. Cross And Embroidery Kits — NEEDS ATTENTION

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Spend | $161.05 (2.96% of account) | — |
| ACoS | 40.10% | Above 30% target |
| ROAS | 2.49 | — |
| Orders | 20 | — |
| Stage | Growth | — |
| P1 Actions | 1 (Broad) | — |

**Key Issue:** Broad campaign ($74.20, 53.05% ACoS) is the main issue at 46% of portfolio spend. SK beginner cross stitch ($18.54, 92.79% ACoS with 1 order) is also problematic. MK cross stitch root TOS ($10.72, 0 orders) is bleeding. Positive: SK cross stitch kits for kids TOS ($22.69, 18.62% ACoS, 6 orders) is a top performer.
**Quick Win:** Lower bids on the broad campaign. Scale SK cross stitch kits for kids TOS which has excellent efficiency.

---

### 12. biggie beads — TOP PERFORMER

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Spend | $155.67 (2.86% of account) | — |
| ACoS | 22.26% | Excellent |
| ROAS | 4.49 | Highest in account |
| Orders | 26 | — |
| Stage | Maintenance | — |
| P1 Actions | 0 | — |

**Key Issue:** None — best performing product portfolio in the account. MK broad TOS ($111.30, 20.25% ACoS, 20 orders) is excellent. Auto ($42.27, 28.20% ACoS, 6 orders) is solid.
**Quick Win:** Consider scaling — this portfolio has room to grow with strong efficiency. Missing product targeting and single keyword campaigns.

---

### 13. Latch hook kits — WATCH

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Spend | $134.94 (2.48% of account) | — |
| ACoS | 32.78% | Slightly above target |
| ROAS | 3.05 | — |
| Orders | 18 | — |
| Stage | Optimization | — |
| P1 Actions | 1 (Product targeting) | — |

**Key Issue:** Product targeting ($25.24, 0 orders) is bleeding money. The TOS push campaign ($56.70, 24.68% ACoS, 9 orders) is the strongest performer. Video ad ($24.09, 40.19% ACoS) needs monitoring. Multiple low-activity TOS campaigns with 0 orders.
**Quick Win:** Pause or lower bids on product targeting. Scale the TOS push campaign.

---

### 14. Needlepoint — RED FLAG (Launch)

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Spend | $130.61 (2.40% of account) | — |
| ACoS | 81.26% | Extremely high |
| ROAS | 1.23 | — |
| Orders | 9 | — |
| Stage | Launch | — |
| P1 Actions | 2 (Broad TOS, Auto) | — |

**Key Issue:** Worst ACoS in the account at 81.26%. Even for a Launch portfolio, this is extreme. Broad TOS ($68.78, 95.63% ACoS) and Auto ($34.77, 65.78% ACoS) are both above 60% ACoS. CVR is only 4.0% — well below the 10% threshold. This product may have a conversion problem (listing quality, price, reviews).
**Quick Win:** Lower bids across the board. Investigate listing quality — with 225 clicks and only 9 orders, the product may need listing optimization before more ad spend.

---

### 15. Dessert Family — RED FLAG (not individually reviewed)

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Spend | $102.91 (1.89% of account) | — |
| ACoS | 64.38% | Very high |
| ROAS | 1.55 | — |
| Orders | 7 | — |
| Stage | Unknown | — |
| P1 Actions | Needs individual review | — |

**Key Issue:** High ACoS at 64.38% with only 7 orders. Individual campaign CSV not provided — recommend running a full portfolio review.
**Quick Win:** Export campaign data and run PPC portfolio review

## Dormant Portfolios

54 portfolios are ENABLED with $0 spend and 0 impressions. Notable named ones:

| Portfolio | Status | Recommendation |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| 4 embroidery flowers | $0 activity | Likely replaced by "4 Flowers embroidery" — clean up |
| Embroidery kits for adults | $0 activity | Investigate or remove |
| Sophie - Auto Low bulk | $0 activity | Investigate or remove |
| Emma & Kate Family | $0 activity | Investigate or remove |
| Bunny knitting other | $0 activity | Investigate or remove |
| Bunny Knitting loom kit | $0 activity | Investigate or remove |
| Latch Needlepoint Minibags | $0 activity | Investigate or remove |
| minibeads pastel | $0 activity | Investigate or remove |
| None/None1-44 (30+ portfolios) | $0 activity | Clean up — these are likely test or abandoned portfolios |

**Recommendation:** Schedule a cleanup session to archive or delete the 54 dormant portfolios. The "None" portfolios in particular create clutter.

---

## Account-Level Recommendations

### Top 3 Priorities This Week

1. **4 Flowers embroidery — Emergency triage:** Pause or lower bids on all campaigns with $10+ spend and 0 orders (SK embroidery for beginners TOS, shield brand self target, SO|PT). This portfolio is burning $416/week at 74.74% ACoS.

2. **fairy family — Lower broad campaign bids:** The main broad campaign ($245.91, 47.31% ACoS) is the single highest-spend above-target campaign in the account. Reducing bids here saves the most money immediately.

3. **Cat And Hat Knitting — Scale auto, cut losers:** The auto campaign ($31.61, 6.95% ACoS, 12 orders) is criminally underfunded at $6/day. Scale it to $12-15/day. Meanwhile, lower bids on the broad ($87.75, 56.29% ACoS) and SK loom knitting TOS ($49.82, 184.66% ACoS).

### Structural Improvements

- **biggie beads** is missing product targeting and single keyword campaigns — add these to capture more traffic for the best-performing portfolio
- **Needlepoint** needs a listing quality audit before scaling PPC further — 4.0% CVR suggests the listing isn't converting, not just the ads
- **Dessert Family** needs an individual portfolio review — $102.91/week at 64.38% ACoS warrants investigation

### Budget Reallocation Opportunities

- **From:** 4 Flowers embroidery zero-order campaigns (~$136/week wasted)
- **To:** biggie beads (scale the 22.26% ACoS portfolio) and Cat And Hat Knitting auto (6.95% ACoS gem)
- **From:** Needlepoint broad TOS ($68.78/week at 95.63% ACoS)
- **To:** Latch Hook Pillow TOS ($60.66/week at 25.30% ACoS — increase budget for proven winner)

### Data Dive Checks Needed

The following TOS campaigns across the account need rank movement verification before making bid changes:

## Account Summary

**Overall Health:** Mixed — the account has strong performers (biggie beads, Catch All Auto, Shield All) pulling the average up, but four Red Flag portfolios (4 Flowers, princess lacing, Needlepoint, Dessert Family) spending ~$1,058/week at ~66% combined ACoS are a significant drag.

**Biggest Win Opportunity:** Reallocating ~$200/week from money-losing campaigns (4 Flowers zero-order campaigns, Needlepoint broad, cat knitting SK loom TOS) to proven winners (biggie beads scaling, cat knitting auto, Latch Hook Pillow TOS) could improve account ROAS by an estimated 10-15%.

**Account ACoS Trajectory:** If all P1 actions are executed, the account ACoS could drop from 33.94% to approximately 28-30%, which would bring it within the optimization target range.
