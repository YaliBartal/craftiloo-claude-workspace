# PPC Portfolio Review: fairy family

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Data Window:** Last 7 days (excl. last 2 days)
**Portfolio Stage:** Growth

> **Stage rationale:** Mix of established campaigns (auto from Nov 2022, TOS SK from Nov 2024) and newer campaigns built out over 2025–2026. Order volume is 66 orders for the period (~9/day) — moderate, not yet at Optimization-level consistency. Structure is mostly built out but SK campaigns are still being added. Focus is on building TOS presence and keyword coverage.

## Portfolio Overview

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Total Spend | $584.75 | — | — |
| Total Sales | $1,553.86 | — | — |
| Portfolio ACoS | 37.63% | ~35% | Above Target |
| Portfolio ROAS | 2.66 | — | — |
| Total Orders | 66 | — | — |
| Total Clicks | 619 | — | — |
| Portfolio CVR | 10.66% | 10% | OK |
| Active Campaigns | 13 (with spend) + 2 near-dormant | — | — |

> **Note:** Portfolio ACoS of 37.63% is slightly above the Growth stage target of ~35%. CVR of 10.66% is healthy and above the 10% threshold — the portfolio is converting well. The primary issue is the broad campaign absorbing ~42% of spend at a high ACoS, pulling the portfolio average above target.

## Action To-Do List

### P1 — Act Now (Highest Impact)

- [ ] **fairy sewing - SPM MK broad**: ACoS 47.31% on 42% of portfolio spend — lower bids moderately across all keywords. Pull search term report and mine for negatives; this campaign is generating volume but bleeding margin.
- [ ] **fairy sewing - SPM SK sewing for kids TOS**: ACoS 86.77% with only 1 order on 24 clicks (CVR 4.17%) — severely under-converting. Lower bids significantly. Check Data Dive for rank movement before cutting; if no rank signal, reduce budget to $5/day or pause.
- [ ] **fairy sewing - manual - product targeting**: Running OUT_OF_BUDGET at $4/day — budget is too low to gather data. Either increase budget to $10–$15/day to give it room to perform, or accept it will underdeliver. ACoS 43.54% is concerning; assess targeting targets before scaling.

### P2 — Investigate & Adjust

- [ ] **fairy sewing - SPM SK kids sewing kits age 5-8 TOS** (new, < 4 weeks old): ACoS 34.19%, CVR 10.38% — solid early performance. Still experimental. Monitor weekly; if CVR holds above 10% for another 2 weeks, gradually raise bids or TOS multiplier.
- [ ] **fairy sewing - SPM MK kids sewing kit root**: ACoS 36.50%, CVR 10.87% — borderline. Minor bid reduction on highest-spend keywords. Check search term report for irrelevant terms to negative out.
- [ ] **fairy sewing - SPM MK sewing kit root TOS**: 12 clicks, $10.09 spend, 0 orders — no conversion in this window. ACoS is undefined (0 orders). Flag: check if this is a consistent pattern or a bad week. If 0 orders is consistent over 3+ weeks, lower bids or pause.
- [ ] **fairy sewing - SPM SK sewing kit for kids ages 8-12 TOS**: 5 clicks, $1.92 spend, 0 orders, TOS IS <5% — severely under-bidding for a TOS campaign. Either raise bids to compete for TOS or reconsider this keyword's viability. Age ~5 months suggests it has never gained traction.

### P3 — Monitor / Scale

- [ ] **fairy sewing - auto**: ACoS 18.37%, CVR 18.52% — top performer. Healthy and efficient. Consider slightly increasing budget (currently $18/day) to capture more volume. Continue mining for new keyword opportunities.
- [ ] **fairy sewing - SPM SK sewing kit for kids TOS**: ACoS 32.24%, CVR 13.46% — solid, above target CVR, ACoS within acceptable Growth range. Maintain current bids. Established campaign (Nov 2024).
- [ ] **fairy sewing - SPM MK sewing kit kids root TOS**: ACoS 31.44%, CVR 9.38% — close to healthy. CVR just below 10% threshold. Minor bid adjustments acceptable; monitor for 1 more week.
- [ ] **ballerina sewing - manual TOS crafts for kids PUSH**: ACoS 25.49%, CVR 11.76% — healthy TOS campaign for ballerina product. Check Data Dive for rank movement signal before any changes.
- [ ] **fairy sewing - SPM SK doll making kit TOS** (new, < 4 weeks old): ACoS 21.38%, CVR 25% (1/4 clicks) — only 4 clicks, too early to conclude. Flag as experimental — needs more data.
- [ ] **fairy sewing - SPM fairy sewing kit for kids TOS**: ACoS 20.61%, CVR 20% (1/5 clicks) — only 11 impressions total (very narrow targeting or very high TOS IS of 50%). Only 5 clicks — needs more data. Interesting early signal; watch closely.

### Structure Gaps

- [ ] **Product targeting campaign running out of budget**: Increase daily budget from $4 to at least $10 to allow proper data collection. A PAT campaign with $4/day cannot compete.
- [ ] **No catch-all or brand defense campaign visible**: Confirm whether a catch-all exists in another portfolio or if one needs to be added.
- [ ] **Ballerina product (B0BNDVTTSH) has near-zero activity**: LOW BID campaigns are not generating data. Either raise bids on these or consolidate into the main campaigns.

## Campaign-by-Campaign Analysis

### 1. fairy sewing - SPM MK broad — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Broad (SPM MK) | — |
| Spend | $245.91 (42.1% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 47.31% | Above Growth target ~35% |
| CVR | 9.13% (22 orders / 241 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $1.02 | — |
| CTR | 0.97% | — |
| Orders | 22 | — |
| Sales | $519.78 | — |
| Budget | $35.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~5 months (started 9/14/25) | — |

**Assessment:** This is the portfolio's biggest spend driver at 42% of total budget, but ACoS of 47.31% and CVR just under 10% make it the primary drag on portfolio efficiency. Broad campaigns at this volume need tight negative keyword management. With 24,808 impressions and only 241 clicks (CTR 0.97%), there is likely a lot of irrelevant traffic being served.

**Recommendation:** Pull the search term report immediately. Add negatives for irrelevant queries. Lower bids moderately on keywords with ACoS > 50% and no orders. Do NOT pause — this campaign is driving 33% of portfolio orders and is a key discovery engine, but it needs tighter targeting.

### 2. fairy sewing - SPM SK kids sewing kits age 5-8 TOS — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Single Keyword TOS (SK TOS) | — |
| Spend | $98.73 (16.9% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 34.19% | At Growth target ~35% |
| CVR | 10.38% (11 orders / 106 clicks) | At 10% |
| CPC | $0.93 | — |
| CTR | 0.98% | — |
| Orders | 11 | — |
| Sales | $288.74 | — |
| Budget | $14.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 20.58% | — |
| Age | < 4 weeks (started 1/18/26) — NEW CAMPAIGN | — |

**Assessment:** Strong early performance for a campaign under 4 weeks old. CVR is at 10% with 11 orders — this is the second-highest order generator in the portfolio. ACoS right at target for Growth stage. TOS IS of 20.58% shows it is getting meaningful top-of-search placement.

**Recommendation:** Flag as experimental — needs more data (< 8 weeks). Do not change bids this week. If CVR stays above 10% after week 4-6, this is a candidate for gradually increasing TOS bid multiplier. Watch closely.

### 3. fairy sewing - SPM SK sewing kit for kids TOS — HEALTHY

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Single Keyword TOS (SK TOS) | — |
| Spend | $52.83 (9.0% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 32.24% | Within Growth target |
| CVR | 13.46% (7 orders / 52 clicks) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $1.02 | — |
| CTR | 3.43% | — |
| Orders | 7 | — |
| Sales | $163.86 | — |
| Budget | $15.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 12.40% | — |
| Age | ~15 months (started 11/18/24) — established | — |

**Assessment:** Solid established TOS SK campaign. CTR of 3.43% is excellent — well above average — indicating strong keyword-to-listing relevance. CVR 13.46% confirms good conversion. ACoS at 32.24% is within range for Growth stage.

**Recommendation:** Maintain current bids. Consider checking Data Dive to see if this keyword is driving rank movement — if so, this is a keeper to protect. If budget is ever constrained, this should be a low-cut campaign.

### 4. fairy sewing - auto — TOP PERFORMER

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Auto (SPA) | — |
| Spend | $40.37 (6.9% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 18.37% | Well below target — excellent |
| CVR | 18.52% (10 orders / 54 clicks) | Well above 10% |
| CPC | $0.75 | — |
| CTR | 3.03% | — |
| Orders | 10 | — |
| Sales | $219.80 | — |
| Budget | $18.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~39 months (started 11/10/22) — veteran | — |

**Assessment:** The portfolio's most efficient campaign. ACoS 18.37% and CVR 18.52% are exceptional. This auto campaign has been running for over 3 years and is still performing well — it has clearly settled on high-converting search terms. Only spending $40/week despite $18/day budget, which suggests it may be self-throttling (Amazon limiting delivery on efficient campaigns, or bids are low relative to competition).

**Recommendation:** Consider increasing budget slightly to $25/day and modestly raising bids to unlock more volume. Continue mining this campaign's search term report monthly for new SK campaign candidates.

### 5. fairy sewing - SPM MK kids sewing kit root — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Multi Keyword (MK) | — |
| Spend | $40.11 (6.9% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 36.50% | Slightly above Growth target |
| CVR | 10.87% (5 orders / 46 clicks) | At 10% |
| CPC | $0.87 | — |
| CTR | 1.76% | — |
| Orders | 5 | — |
| Sales | $109.90 | — |
| Budget | $8.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 8.49% | — |
| Age | ~12 months (started 2/19/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Borderline performance — ACoS slightly above Growth target but CVR is holding at 10.87%. With only $8/day budget, this campaign is constrained. The modest TOS IS of 8.49% suggests some TOS placement.

**Recommendation:** Pull search term report and negative out any irrelevant queries to tighten ACoS. Minor bid reductions on keywords with ACoS > 45%. Consider whether the $8/day budget is artificially limiting this campaign.

### 6. fairy sewing - manual - product targeting — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Product Targeting (PAT) | — |
| Spend | $28.71 (4.9% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 43.54% | Above Growth target |
| CVR | 15.79% (3 orders / 19 clicks) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $1.51 | — |
| CTR | 1.93% | — |
| Orders | 3 | — |
| Sales | $65.94 | — |
| Budget | $4.00/day — **OUT OF BUDGET** | — |
| TOS IS | 20.51% | — |
| Age | ~10 months (started 4/10/25) | — |

**Assessment:** This campaign is running OUT_OF_BUDGET daily on only $4/day — it is being starved of budget. CVR of 15.79% is strong, which suggests the product targeting is hitting relevant ASINs. However, ACoS at 43.54% with high CPC of $1.51 is concerning. The budget constraint means we don't have a true picture of efficiency at scale.

**Recommendation:** Two-step: (1) Increase budget to at least $10/day to remove the budget ceiling and get a fuller data picture. (2) Review ASIN targets — remove any targets that are generating clicks but no orders. With CPC at $1.51 (highest in portfolio), evaluate whether the targeted ASINs have strong enough conversion to justify the cost.

### 7. fairy sewing - SPM SK sewing for kids TOS — FLAG

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Single Keyword TOS (SK TOS) | — |
| Spend | $23.41 (4.0% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 86.77% | Severely above target |
| CVR | 4.17% (1 order / 24 clicks) | Well below 10% |
| CPC | $0.98 | — |
| CTR | 1.35% | — |
| Orders | 1 | — |
| Sales | $26.98 | — |
| Budget | $15.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 30.49% | — |
| Age | ~6 months (started 8/19/25) | — |

**Assessment:** High TOS IS (30.49%) with very low CVR (4.17%) is a red flag — this campaign is getting premium placement but shoppers are not buying. ACoS of 86.77% means it is spending nearly $1 for every $1 of sales. This is not a new campaign issue (6 months old). Either the keyword "sewing for kids" is too generic, or the listing is not converting this traffic.

**Recommendation:** Check Data Dive for any rank movement on this keyword before cutting. If no rank signal, lower bids significantly to reduce spend. If ACoS does not improve below 50% within 2 weeks, reduce budget to $3-5/day or pause. Consider whether this keyword is being cannibalized by the broad campaign.

### 8. fairy sewing - SPM MK sewing kit kids root TOS — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Multi Keyword TOS (MK TOS) | — |
| Spend | $20.73 (3.5% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 31.44% | Within Growth target |
| CVR | 9.38% (3 orders / 32 clicks) | Slightly below 10% |
| CPC | $0.65 | — |
| CTR | 1.63% | — |
| Orders | 3 | — |
| Sales | $65.94 | — |
| Budget | $14.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~20 months (started 6/27/24) — established | — |

**Assessment:** Established TOS MK campaign with ACoS within target and CVR just under 10%. Despite being labeled TOS, the TOS IS is <5%, which suggests bids may be insufficient to actually win TOS placements consistently. CPC at $0.65 is the lowest of the manual campaigns.

**Recommendation:** Acceptable performance — minor bid adjustment acceptable if ACoS stays in range. Check Data Dive for rank signal. The low TOS IS despite "TOS" branding in campaign name warrants investigation — consider raising TOS placement bid modifier to improve TOS IS.

### 9. ballerina sewing - manual TOS crafts for kids PUSH — HEALTHY

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | TOS Push (MANUAL TOS) | — |
| Spend | $12.48 (2.1% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 25.49% | Below Growth target — good |
| CVR | 11.76% (2 orders / 17 clicks) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $0.73 | — |
| CTR | 1.93% | — |
| Orders | 2 | — |
| Sales | $48.96 | — |
| Budget | $26.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~10 months (started 4/26/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Efficient campaign for the ballerina product with ACoS well within target and CVR above 10%. Spending only $12.48 against a $26/day budget — significant underspend. TOS IS <5% despite being a TOS Push campaign; bids may be too low to compete for TOS.

**Recommendation:** Check Data Dive for rank signal on "crafts for kids" keywords. The large gap between budget ($26/day) and actual spend ($12.48 for the week) suggests under-bidding — consider raising base bids or TOS multiplier to capture more TOS placements. Healthy campaign overall; prioritize getting more out of it.

### 10. fairy sewing - SPM MK sewing kit root TOS — FLAG

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Multi Keyword TOS (MK TOS) | — |
| Spend | $10.09 (1.7% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | No conversion this period |
| CVR | 0% (0 orders / 12 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.84 | — |
| CTR | 1.95% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $15.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 8.25% | — |
| Age | ~12 months (started 2/13/25) | — |

**Assessment:** $10.09 spent with zero orders is a concern — though 12 clicks is a small sample size and one bad week can cause this. However, this is an established 12-month-old campaign. Check if 0-order weeks are a recurring pattern. TOS IS of 8.25% shows some TOS placement but not enough.

**Recommendation:** Check historical performance over the last 30-60 days in Seller Central. If this campaign has been consistently yielding poor conversion rates, lower bids significantly and reduce budget to $5/day. If this week is an anomaly, hold for another week before acting. Check Data Dive for rank contribution.

### 11. fairy sewing - SPM SK doll making kit TOS — WATCH (NEW)

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Single Keyword TOS (SK TOS) | — |
| Spend | $4.70 (0.8% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 21.38% | Below Growth target — good |
| CVR | 25.00% (1 order / 4 clicks) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $1.18 | — |
| CTR | 1.27% | — |
| Orders | 1 | — |
| Sales | $21.98 | — |
| Budget | $11.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 17.98% | — |
| Age | < 4 weeks (started 1/19/26) — NEW CAMPAIGN | — |

**Assessment:** Only 4 clicks — far too early to draw conclusions. The single order gives an artificially strong CVR and ACoS. Flag as experimental. The keyword "doll making kit" is an interesting adjacent keyword for the fairy sewing audience.

**Recommendation:** No changes. Let it run for at least 6-8 weeks and accumulate 30+ clicks before evaluating performance. Check TOS IS again in 2 weeks.

### 12. fairy sewing - SPM fairy sewing kit for kids TOS — WATCH (NEW)

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | TOS Push (SPM TOS) | — |
| Spend | $4.53 (0.8% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 20.61% | Below Growth target — good |
| CVR | 20.00% (1 order / 5 clicks) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $0.91 | — |
| CTR | 45.45% | — |
| Orders | 1 | — |
| Sales | $21.98 | — |
| Budget | $20.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 50% | — |
| Age | ~6 months (started 8/10/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Unusual data — only 11 impressions with 5 clicks (CTR 45.45%) and TOS IS of 50%. This is a very narrow targeting situation, possibly a highly specific keyword or placement. The 50% TOS IS on only 11 impressions suggests extremely limited delivery. Despite positive-looking metrics, sample size is far too small for conclusions.

**Recommendation:** Investigate why impressions are so low for a 6-month-old campaign with a $20/day budget. The keyword may have very low search volume, or bids may need adjustment to win impressions more consistently. Check if the campaign is limited by keyword search volume.

### 13. fairy sewing - SPM SK sewing kit for kids ages 8-12 TOS — FLAG

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Single Keyword TOS (SK TOS) | — |
| Spend | $1.92 (0.3% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | No conversion this period |
| CVR | 0% (0 orders / 5 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.38 | — |
| CTR | 1.13% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $30.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~5 months (started 9/14/25) | — |

**Assessment:** A 5-month-old TOS SK campaign with $30/day budget spending only $1.92 for the week — this is a severely under-bidding campaign. CPC of $0.38 will never win TOS placements competitively. TOS IS <5% confirms this. Only 441 impressions for a week means Amazon is barely serving this campaign.

**Recommendation:** Either raise bids significantly to compete for TOS placements (this is the campaign's stated purpose), or evaluate whether "sewing kit for kids ages 8-12" has sufficient search volume to justify a dedicated campaign. If raising bids, set a target CPC of at least $0.80-$1.00 to test competitiveness. If no improvement in TOS IS after 2 weeks, consider pausing.

## Dormant Campaigns (ENABLED but near-zero activity)

| Campaign | Budget | Start Date | Spend | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|------------|-------|----------------|
| B0BNDVTTSH Ballerina LOW BID MANUAL TARGETING | $10.00/day | 3/30/24 | $0.12 | Near-dead (2 years old, $0.12 spend). Either significantly raise bids to activate or pause — it is not contributing data. |
| B09WQSBZY7 Fairy LOW BID MANUAL TARGETING | $10.00/day | 3/30/24 | $0.11 | Same as above — 2 years old, near-zero spend. Raise bids meaningfully or pause. These appear to be product-targeting campaigns that have been abandoned. |

## Structure Check

| Required Type | Present? | Campaign | Status |
|--------------|----------|----------|--------|
| Auto | Yes | fairy sewing - auto | Healthy — top performer, 18.37% ACoS |
| Broad | Yes | fairy sewing - SPM MK broad | Needs work — 47.31% ACoS, negative management needed |
| Product Targeting | Yes | fairy sewing - manual - product targeting | Needs work — OUT_OF_BUDGET at $4/day, budget too low |
| Single Keyword (TOS) | Yes | Multiple SK TOS campaigns | Mixed — some healthy, some flagged |
| Multi Keyword (TOS) | Yes | Multiple MK TOS campaigns | Mixed — some healthy, one flagged |
| Brand / Product Defense | Unclear | Not visible in this data | Verify if catch-all or brand defense exists in another portfolio |

**Gaps:**
- **Product targeting budget is critically low ($4/day)** — this campaign runs out of budget daily and cannot gather proper data. This is a structural gap in execution, not campaign setup.
- **No catch-all campaign visible** — confirm if one exists elsewhere. At Growth stage, a catch-all at strict ACoS (20-25%) is recommended.
- **Two near-dead LOW BID campaigns** (2 years old) are cluttering the portfolio without contributing. Clean up or revive.
- **Ballerina product has limited representation** — only one TOS PUSH campaign at low spend. If ballerina is a meaningful product in this portfolio, it needs its own auto + broad structure.

---

## Summary

**What's working:**
- **Auto campaign is the efficiency anchor** — 18.37% ACoS, 18.52% CVR, and 3+ years of reliable performance. This is the portfolio's foundation.
- **New SK TOS campaigns (Jan 2026) showing strong early signals** — "kids sewing kits age 5-8" at 34.19% ACoS and 10.38% CVR with 11 orders in under 4 weeks is a promising launch.

**What needs attention:**
- **The broad campaign (42% of spend, 47.31% ACoS) is the single biggest efficiency problem** — pulling the portfolio from 30% to 37.63% ACoS by itself. Negative keyword cleanup here will have the highest ROI of any action this week.
- **"Sewing for kids" TOS SK at 86.77% ACoS** — 6 months old with 1/24 clicks converting. This is burning money without return. Needs immediate bid reduction and a Data Dive check.

**Quick wins:**
1. Pull search term report for the MK broad campaign → add negatives for irrelevant queries → estimated ACoS improvement: 5-10 points over 2 weeks.
2. Lower bids significantly on "fairy sewing - SPM SK sewing for kids TOS" → immediate spend reduction → check Data Dive first.

**Data Dive checks needed:**
- fairy sewing - SPM SK sewing for kids TOS (86.77% ACoS — check if rank is moving before cutting)
- fairy sewing - SPM MK sewing kit kids root TOS (TOS IS <5% despite TOS label — check rank contribution)
- fairy sewing - SPM MK sewing kit root TOS (0 orders this week — check historical trend)
- ballerina sewing - manual TOS crafts for kids PUSH (healthy but large budget-spend gap — check rank signal)
