## Action To-Do List

### P1 — Act Now (Highest Impact)

- [ ] **B09X55KL2C 10 Embroidery kit - SP - EXACT**: ACoS 56% with only 6.45% CVR — lower bids significantly. This is a 2+ year old exact campaign bleeding spend with poor conversion. Either cut bids meaningfully or evaluate pausing.
- [ ] **embroidery beginner - SPM MK needlepoint root TOS**: $20.88 spend with 0 orders — 31 clicks, 0 conversions. Flag as urgent. Check search term report for relevance before keeping live. If targeting is off-theme, pause and redirect budget.

### P2 — Investigate & Adjust

- [ ] **embroidery beginner - SPM MK broad TOS**: ACoS 38.76%, CVR 9.72% — nearly hitting 10% CVR, but ACoS is above the 35% Growth target. Reduce bids slightly or lower TOS% modifier. Do not cut aggressively — this is the portfolio's highest spend campaign and driving real volume (14 orders).
- [ ] **embroidery beginners - SPM SK embroidery kit for beginners TOS**: ACoS 36.97%, CVR 11.11% — CVR is healthy, ACoS slightly above target. Minor bid reduction only. Check if TOS IS can be verified; shows <5% which seems inconsistent with a TOS campaign.
- [ ] **embroidery beginner exact video (SB2)**: ACoS 34.13%, CVR 8.43% — just under target ACoS but CVR is below 10%. Monitor closely. DPV of 178 is positive signal for awareness. Check Data Dive for any rank correlation before adjusting.
- [ ] **embroidery beginner - manual - product targeting**: ACoS 37.76%, CVR 8.62% — both metrics are close to targets but not there yet. Check which ASINs are being targeted; tighten to 3-5 high-converting targets. Minor bid reduction if irrelevant ASINs are eating spend.
- [ ] **embroidery beginner - SPM SK easy embroidery kit beginner TOS**: Only 1 click, $1.27 spend, 0 orders — campaign is brand new (12/7/25, ~10 weeks old). Still experimental. Flag for more data — do not cut yet. Investigate why impressions are so low (104 impressions only). Bids may be too low to compete.
- [ ] **B09X55KL2C 10 embroidery LOW BID AUTO TOS / LOW BID AUTO low bid / LOW BID Manual Research**: All three are under-bidding — combined $0.63 spend, 0 orders across 5 clicks. Started 3/30/24 — nearly 2 years old with minimal activity. Either raise bids meaningfully to test viability or cut them to reclaim budget cap space.

### P3 — Monitor / Scale

- [ ] No campaigns currently qualify for scaling — all active campaigns with orders are above the 35% ACoS target or below 10% CVR.

### Structure Gaps

- [ ] **Missing standard Auto campaign**: The two "LOW BID AUTO" campaigns are deliberately low-bid research tools, not functioning auto campaigns. Consider building a properly-bidded Auto SP campaign to harvest new search terms at competitive bids.
- [ ] **Missing Broad campaign**: No active standard broad match campaign exists. A broad campaign is required per SOP to capture head terms and feed the keyword funnel.

## Campaign-by-Campaign Analysis

### 1. embroidery beginner - SPM MK broad TOS — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | MK (Multi-Keyword) / TOS | — |
| Spend | $140.99 (38.2% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 38.76% | Above 35% target |
| CVR | 9.72% (14 orders / 144 clicks) | Just below 10% |
| CPC | $0.98 | — |
| CTR | 1.69% | — |
| Orders | 14 | — |
| Sales | $363.72 | — |
| Budget | $20.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | Low for a TOS campaign |
| Age | ~10 weeks (started 12/7/25) | — |

**Assessment:** This is the portfolio's workhorse — 38% of all spend, 40% of all orders, 40% of all sales. ACoS is 3.76 points above the Growth stage target, and CVR is just shy of 10%. The TOS IS showing <5% despite the TOS label is notable — either TOS bids aren't winning or the modifier is set low. New campaign (~10 weeks), so some tolerance is warranted.

**Recommendation:** Lower bids slightly (10-15%) to push ACoS toward 35%. Before cutting bids on TOS, check Data Dive to see if this campaign is contributing to rank improvement. If rank is moving, hold bids and focus on negative keyword hygiene instead.

### 2. embroidery beginners - SPM SK embroidery kit for beginners TOS — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | SK (Single Keyword) / TOS | — |
| Spend | $64.65 (17.5% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 36.97% | Slightly above 35% target |
| CVR | 11.11% (7 orders / 63 clicks) | Above 10% |
| CPC | $1.03 | — |
| CTR | 4.38% | — |
| Orders | 7 | — |
| Sales | $174.86 | — |
| Budget | $35.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | Low for a TOS campaign |
| Age | ~16 weeks (started 10/27/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Best CVR in the portfolio at 11.11%. ACoS is only 2 points above the Growth target, and conversion is strong. This SK campaign is working. The <5% TOS IS is suspicious — a TOS-focused SK campaign should be winning TOS placements more consistently. Either TOS modifier is too low or competition is pricing it out.

**Recommendation:** Minor bid reduction (5-8%) to bring ACoS to ~35%. Separately, investigate and increase the TOS placement modifier — if TOS IS is genuinely <5%, the campaign isn't fulfilling its TOS mandate. Check Data Dive for keyword rank on "embroidery kit for beginners."

### 3. embroidery beginner exact video — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Video (SB2) | — |
| Spend | $62.06 (16.8% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 34.13% | Below 35% target — healthy |
| CVR | 8.43% (7 orders / 83 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.75 | — |
| CTR | 0.75% | Low (normal for video) |
| Orders | 7 | — |
| Sales | $181.86 | — |
| Budget | $10.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 7.05% | — |
| DPV | 178 | Positive awareness signal |
| Age | ~21 months (started 5/22/24) | — |

**Assessment:** The only campaign at or below the ACoS target. ACoS 34.13% is within the Growth stage range, and DPV of 178 shows strong top-of-funnel awareness contribution. CVR at 8.43% is slightly below 10% but this is normal for video — customers view video, then convert via another touchpoint. Budget at $10/day is capped low relative to performance.

**Recommendation:** Do not cut this campaign. Monitor CVR trend. Check Data Dive for any rank or BSR correlation to the video. Consider increasing daily budget slightly — this is hitting its budget at $10/day and is the only campaign with ACoS on target.

### 4. embroidery beginner - manual - product targeting — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | PAT (Product Targeting) | — |
| Spend | $48.30 (13.1% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 37.76% | Above 35% target |
| CVR | 8.62% (5 orders / 58 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.83 | — |
| CTR | 3.72% | — |
| Orders | 5 | — |
| Sales | $127.90 | — |
| Budget | $7.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~10 months (started 4/10/25) | — |

**Assessment:** PAT campaign spending above its ACoS target with below-10% CVR. 58 clicks with only 5 orders suggests some targeting irrelevance — product targets may include competitor listings where our product isn't the obvious substitute, or low-intent browse traffic. 10 months old, so "needs more data" tolerance doesn't apply.

**Recommendation:** Pull the search term / targeting report. Remove ASIN targets with high clicks and 0 orders. Narrow to 3-5 highest-converting ASINs (complementary or direct competitor). Minor bid reduction (10%) to improve ACoS while audit is underway.

### 5. B09X55KL2C 10 Embroidery kit - SP - EXACT — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | SK (Single Keyword / Exact) | — |
| Spend | $30.24 (8.2% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 56.04% | Well above 35% target |
| CVR | 6.45% (2 orders / 31 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.98 | — |
| CTR | 1.87% | — |
| Orders | 2 | — |
| Sales | $53.96 | — |
| Budget | $4.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~26 months (started 12/1/23) | — |

**Assessment:** The worst-performing campaign in the portfolio on ACoS. At 56% ACoS with 6.45% CVR, this exact campaign is both expensive and converting poorly. It's 2+ years old — no "learning phase" excuse. High ACoS + low CVR = wrong targeting or over-bidding on competitive terms. It is actively losing money.

**Recommendation:** Lower bids significantly (25-30%). If ACoS doesn't improve within 2 weeks, evaluate pausing. Check which exact keywords are in this campaign — some may be too broad/competitive for exact match at this CPC.

### 6. embroidery beginner - SPM MK needlepoint root TOS — FLAG

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | MK (Multi-Keyword) / TOS | — |
| Spend | $20.88 (5.7% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | — |
| CVR | 0% (0 orders / 31 clicks) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.67 | — |
| CTR | 1.41% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $8.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 10.27% | — |
| Age | ~26 weeks (started 8/19/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Urgent flag. $20.88 spent, 31 clicks, 0 orders. "Needlepoint" is a different craft niche from embroidery — there is likely a keyword relevance problem. Customers searching for needlepoint supplies are not necessarily looking for embroidery kits. 26 weeks of running with 0 orders is a significant bleed.

**Recommendation:** Pause this campaign immediately pending a search term audit. Pull search terms to confirm whether "needlepoint" traffic is converting anywhere in the portfolio. If the keyword set is genuinely off-niche, cut the campaign and reallocate the $8/day budget to the video campaign or the SK TOS campaign.

### 7. embroidery beginner - SPM SK easy embroidery kit beginner TOS — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | SK (Single Keyword) / TOS | — |
| Spend | $1.27 (0.3% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | — |
| CVR | 0% (0 orders / 1 click) | — |
| CPC | $1.27 | — |
| CTR | 0.96% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $20.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 14.90% | Winning TOS placements |
| Age | ~10 weeks (started 12/7/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Brand new SK TOS campaign with almost no data — 104 impressions and 1 click in the data window. Despite $20/day budget, impressions are very low, which suggests bids are not competitive enough to win volume even though TOS IS of 14.90% shows it occasionally wins. Too early to evaluate performance.

**Recommendation:** Flag as experimental — needs more data. The campaign is only 10 weeks old. Investigate if bid is set high enough to generate meaningful impression volume for "easy embroidery kit beginner." If impression share remains this low at week 12-14, increase bids.

### 8. B09X55KL2C 10 embroidery LOW BID AUTO TOS — FLAG

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Auto (Research) | — |
| Spend | $0.30 (0.1% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | — |
| CVR | 0% (0 orders / 1 click) | — |
| CPC | $0.30 | — |
| CTR | 7.14% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $10.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~23 months (started 3/30/24) | — |

**Assessment:** Near-zero activity campaign running almost 2 years. Intentionally low-bid for research purposes, but generating almost nothing useful at this spend level. 14 impressions in the window means it's essentially invisible.

**Recommendation:** Flag as dead research campaign. Either raise bids to make it a functional auto discovery campaign or consolidate into a single properly-bidded auto campaign. Current state wastes account budget cap space.

---

### 9. B09X55KL2C 10 embroidery LOW BID AUTO low bid — FLAG

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Auto (Research) | — |
| Spend | $0.25 (0.1% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | — |
| CVR | 0% (0 orders / 3 clicks) | — |
| CPC | $0.08 | — |
| CTR | 0.65% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $10.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~23 months (started 3/30/24) | — |

**Assessment:** Second low-bid auto campaign. $0.08 CPC suggests it's winning only the lowest-quality placements. 465 impressions with 3 clicks — some visibility but nothing useful in 23 months.

**Recommendation:** Same as above — either raise bids and commit to using this as the portfolio's primary auto discovery campaign, or cut it. Having two separate low-bid autos with overlapping targeting is redundant.

---

### 10. B09X55KL2C 10 embroidery LOW BID Manual Research — FLAG

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Manual (Research / Broad) | — |
| Spend | $0.08 (0.02% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | — |
| CVR | 0% (0 orders / 1 click) | — |
| CPC | $0.08 | — |
| CTR | 0.40% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $10.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~23 months (started 3/30/24) | — |

**Assessment:** Manual research campaign with $0.08 CPC — essentially invisible in all meaningful placements. 249 impressions, 1 click, 0 orders in 23 months. Not functioning as a research tool at this bid level.

**Recommendation:** Pause or repurpose. If keyword research is needed, raise bids to competitive levels and run for 2-3 weeks intentionally, then harvest terms. Do not keep running at $0.08 CPC indefinitely — it produces no actionable data.

## Dormant Campaigns (ENABLED but no activity)

| Campaign | Budget | Start Date | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|------------|----------------|
| B09X55KL2C 10 embroidery LOW BID product targeting | $10.00/day | 3/30/24 | Increase bids to test or pause — nearly 2 years with no impressions |

---

## Structure Check

| Required Type | Present? | Campaign | Status |
|--------------|----------|----------|--------|
| Auto | Partial | LOW BID AUTO TOS / LOW BID AUTO low bid | Present but under-bidding — not functioning as a real auto campaign |
| Broad | No | Missing | Gap — no active broad match campaign |
| Product Targeting | Yes | embroidery beginner - manual - product targeting | Active but ACoS above target |
| Single Keyword | Yes | SPM SK embroidery kit for beginners TOS / SPM SK easy embroidery kit beginner TOS | Active — one performing, one too early to evaluate |
| Multi-Keyword | Yes | SPM MK broad TOS / SPM MK needlepoint root TOS | Active — broad TOS working; needlepoint TOS flagged |
| Video (SB/SBV) | Yes | embroidery beginner exact video | Active and on target |
| Sponsored Display | No | Missing (PAUSED: embroidery sdisplay) | Gap — paused SD campaign could be reactivated |

**Gaps:**
1. **No real Auto campaign** — The two LOW BID AUTO campaigns are not functioning auto discovery tools. The portfolio needs a properly-bidded SP Auto campaign to harvest new search terms and feed the keyword funnel. This is a core SOP requirement.
2. **No Broad campaign** — The "LOW BID Manual Research" serves a broad-like function but is too under-bidded to be useful. A standard broad match SP campaign with competitive bids is missing.
3. **SD campaign is paused** — Sponsored Display was active (paused 5/4/24, per the PAUSED entries). Consider reactivating if the Growth stage warrants retargeting traffic.

## Summary

**What's working:**
- The SK "embroidery kit for beginners" TOS campaign has the best CVR in the portfolio (11.11%) and is just above the ACoS target — it's the clearest scaling candidate once ACoS is trimmed.
- The video campaign (SB2) is the only campaign at or below ACoS target (34.13%) and is generating strong DPV (178), contributing top-of-funnel awareness alongside direct orders.

**What needs attention:**
- The SP EXACT campaign (56% ACoS, 6.45% CVR) is the portfolio's worst performer and has been running 2+ years with no improvement signal — immediate bid reduction required.
- The "needlepoint root TOS" campaign has spent $20.88 with 0 orders — keyword relevance is likely the issue (needlepoint vs. embroidery), and it needs to be paused pending a search term audit.

**Quick wins:**
1. Pause "embroidery beginner - SPM MK needlepoint root TOS" immediately — stop the bleed while you audit the search terms. Redirect the $8/day budget to the video campaign.
2. Lower bids significantly on "B09X55KL2C 10 Embroidery kit - SP - EXACT" — at 56% ACoS with poor CVR, this campaign needs a hard reset before further review.

**Data Dive checks needed:**
- `embroidery beginner - SPM MK broad TOS` — verify whether TOS IS is actually driving rank movement before cutting bids. ACoS justification depends on rank contribution.
- `embroidery beginners - SPM SK embroidery kit for beginners TOS` — check rank movement on "embroidery kit for beginners." TOS IS showing <5% for a TOS campaign is a red flag.
- `embroidery beginner exact video` — confirm if video spend correlates with BSR or rank improvement for embroidery beginner terms.
- `embroidery beginner - SPM MK needlepoint root TOS` — pull search terms to confirm whether "needlepoint" traffic is totally off-niche before pausing.
