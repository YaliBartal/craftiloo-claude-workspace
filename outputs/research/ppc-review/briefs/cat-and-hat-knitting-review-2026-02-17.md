## Portfolio Overview

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Total Spend | $247.27 | — | — |
| Total Sales | $822.36 | — | — |
| Portfolio ACoS | 30.07% | ~35% (Growth stage) | OK |
| Portfolio ROAS | 3.33x | — | — |
| Total Orders | 26 | — | — |
| Portfolio CVR | 8.23% (26/316) | 10% | Below Target |
| Active Campaigns (with data) | 10 | — | — |
| Dormant Campaigns (ENABLED, no activity) | 2 | — | — |

**Stage rationale:** Portfolio has campaigns dating back to August 2025 (~6 months) alongside very new campaigns from January 2026 (~6 weeks). Order volume of 26/week falls at the lower bound of Growth stage. Campaign structure is broad — Auto, Broad, PAT, and multiple SK/TOS campaigns exist — consistent with a portfolio actively building out its structure.

**Data note:** The export includes a PAUSED campaign (`cat knitting - SPM SK beginner knitting kit TOS`) which has been excluded from all analysis per SOP.

## Action To-Do List

### P1 — Act Now (Highest Impact)

- [ ] **cat knitting - SPM SK loom knitting kit TOS** ($49.82 spend, ACoS 184.66%, CVR 1.82%): Campaign is bleeding — 1 order from 55 clicks at extremely high ACoS. Lower bids significantly or pause until keyword and targeting strategy is reviewed. This is only 6 weeks old — evaluate whether "loom knitting kit" is a relevant term before investing further.
- [ ] **cat knitting - SPM broad** ($87.75 spend, ACoS 56.29%, CVR 7.32%): Highest spend campaign with ACoS nearly double the Growth stage target. CVR is acceptable but not high enough to justify ACoS this elevated. Lower bids significantly and pull the search term report — identify and negate irrelevant terms urgently.
- [ ] **cat knitting - SPM knitting kit for kids TOS** ($11.61 spend, 0 orders, ACoS N/A): Zero orders from 12 clicks and $11.61 in spend — bleeding with no return. Pause this campaign or significantly reduce budget. Check search terms and TOS IS (29.46% TOS IS shows it's showing prominently but not converting).

### P2 — Investigate & Adjust

- [ ] **cat knitting - SPM product targeting** ($51.20 spend, ACoS 37.95%, CVR 7.81%): ACoS is modestly above Growth target of 35% and CVR is just below 10%. Pull the targeting report — identify which ASINs are converting and which are wasting spend. Negate poor performers and consider a minor bid reduction on non-converting targets.
- [ ] **cat knitting - SPM SK loom kit for kids TOS** ($3.36 spend, 0 orders, CVR 0%): 4 clicks, 0 orders. Low spend but a 0% CVR pattern worth monitoring. Campaign is ~3 months old — not "new" enough to excuse zero performance. Check if keyword is relevant; if no improvement by next review cycle, evaluate pausing.
- [ ] **cat knitting - SPM other root TOS** ($2.91 spend, 0 orders, CVR 0%): 7 clicks, 0 orders, campaign started August 2025 (6 months old). Persistent zero conversion on a mature campaign is a flag. Pull search terms — if the "other root" terms are not relevant to the product, pause or restructure.
- [ ] **cat knitting - SPM knitting kit for beginners TOS** ($0.35 spend, ENABLED, 1 click): Very low spend — under-bidding. Either increase bids to make this campaign meaningful or evaluate whether this TOS keyword slot is worth keeping active. At current spend levels it provides no usable data.

### P3 — Monitor / Scale

- [ ] **cat knitting - SPA auto** ($31.61 spend, ACoS 6.95%, CVR 15.58%): Top performer. Budget is only $6/day and it is producing. Increase daily budget — this campaign is likely budget-constrained and could drive significantly more orders if given room to spend.
- [ ] **cat knitting - SPM SK knitting beginner kit TOS** ($5.83 spend, ACoS 21.61%, CVR 9.09%): Healthy performance for a 6-week-old campaign. CVR just below 10% with efficient ACoS. Monitor for another 2-3 weeks before adjusting bids. Trending positive.
- [ ] **cat knitting - SPM SK loom animals kit for kids TOS** ($2.83 spend, ACoS 12.32%, CVR 33.33%): Only 3 clicks but all signals are exceptional. Low spend, very high CVR, strong TOS IS (35.29%). Raise bids — this campaign is underdelivering given its efficiency. Check Data Dive to see if rank is moving on this term.

### Structure Gaps

- [ ] **Budget constraint on Auto campaign:** Auto ($6/day budget) is the portfolio's best performer but almost certainly budget-limited. Increase budget to at least $15-20/day to match spend potential.
- [ ] **TOS campaign bloat:** Portfolio has 7+ TOS campaigns, several of which are producing zero results. Consolidate — focus budget on the 2-3 TOS campaigns showing any conversion signal (SK loom animals kit, SK knitting beginner kit).
- [ ] **No MK (Multi-Keyword) campaign identified:** Portfolio uses Single Keyword and broad match campaigns but has no dedicated multi-keyword campaign. Consider building one with the top converting terms from the Auto and Broad search term reports.

## Campaign-by-Campaign Analysis

### 1. cat knitting - SPM broad — NEEDS ACTION

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Broad (SPM Broad) | — |
| Spend | $87.75 (35.5% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 56.29% | Well Above Growth target ~35% |
| CVR | 7.32% (6/82) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $1.07 | — |
| CTR | 2.59% | — |
| Orders | 6 | — |
| Sales | $155.88 | — |
| Budget | $15.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~6 months (started 8/11/25) | — |

**Assessment:** This is the portfolio's largest spend campaign at 35.5% of total budget, but ACoS at 56.29% is severely above target. At 6 months old, this campaign should be optimized by now. CVR of 7.32% indicates some targeting relevance, but the broad match is clearly capturing irrelevant traffic that drives up CPC without converting.

**Recommendation:** Pull the search term report immediately. Negate irrelevant and low-CVR terms aggressively. Lower bids significantly (not slightly — this needs a meaningful correction). Consider splitting top-converting search terms into dedicated SK campaigns rather than leaving them in broad match at elevated CPCs.

### 2. cat knitting - SPM product targeting — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Product Targeting (PAT) | — |
| Spend | $51.20 (20.7% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 37.95% | Above Growth target ~35% |
| CVR | 7.81% (5/64) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.80 | — |
| CTR | 1.71% | — |
| Orders | 5 | — |
| Sales | $134.90 | — |
| Budget | $14.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 8.21% | — |
| Age | ~4 months (started 10/15/25) | — |

**Assessment:** ACoS is modestly above Growth target and CVR is just shy of 10%. This campaign is not far off — it's in "watch" territory rather than crisis. The product targeting mix likely contains some high-converting ASINs being diluted by low-converting ones. At 4 months old it has enough data to make targeting decisions.

**Recommendation:** Pull the targeting report. Negate ASINs with spend and zero orders. Consider a minor bid reduction (5-10%) on targets with ACoS > 50%. If the top 2-3 ASINs are driving all conversions, consider splitting them into a tighter PAT campaign with a higher bid to capture more of those placements.

### 3. cat knitting - SPM SK loom knitting kit TOS — FLAG

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Single Keyword / TOS | — |
| Spend | $49.82 (20.1% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 184.66% | Extreme — Well Above any target |
| CVR | 1.82% (1/55) | Well Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.91 | — |
| CTR | 0.85% | — |
| Orders | 1 | — |
| Sales | $26.98 | — |
| Budget | $16.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 6.61% | — |
| Age | ~6 weeks (started 1/7/26) | — |

**Assessment:** Critical flag. This campaign is consuming 20% of portfolio spend and returning $26.98 in sales against $49.82 in spend — an ACoS of 185%. CVR of 1.82% suggests poor keyword-to-product fit or a highly competitive placement. At 6 weeks old it is still in experimental territory, but the scale of loss ($49 spend, $27 sales) is too significant to leave unchecked.

**Recommendation:** Lower bids significantly or pause immediately pending strategy review. "Loom knitting kit" may not be the right TOS term for this product — check Data Dive to see if rank is moving on this keyword. If no rank movement is occurring, this campaign is not justified at current spend. Do not let this continue at current pace into next review cycle.

### 4. cat knitting - SPA auto — TOP PERFORMER

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Auto (SPA) | — |
| Spend | $31.61 (12.8% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 6.95% | Well Below target — Excellent |
| CVR | 15.58% (12/77) | Above 10% — Excellent |
| CPC | $0.41 | — |
| CTR | 0.71% | — |
| Orders | 12 | — |
| Sales | $454.64 | — |
| Budget | $6.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~6 months (started 8/11/25) | — |

**Assessment:** This is the portfolio's standout performer. ACoS of 6.95% with CVR of 15.58% — it is converting at exceptional rates and generating $454.64 of the portfolio's $822.36 total sales (55% of sales from 12.8% of spend). The $6/day budget is almost certainly the bottleneck. This campaign is being starved.

**Recommendation:** Increase daily budget significantly — minimum to $15/day, ideally $20-25/day. Also pull the search term report to identify top-converting terms for promotion into dedicated SK campaigns. This is the engine of the portfolio and should be the top budget priority.

### 5. cat knitting - SPM knitting kit for kids TOS — FLAG

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | TOS (Single Keyword) | — |
| Spend | $11.61 (4.7% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | — |
| CVR | 0% (0/12) | Well Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.97 | — |
| CTR | 0.64% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $20.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 29.46% | High TOS IS with zero conversion |
| Age | ~6 months (started 8/11/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Urgent flag. Zero orders from 12 clicks and $11.61 in spend. The 29.46% TOS IS tells us this campaign IS showing prominently at the top of search, but generating zero sales. At 6 months old this is not a "needs more data" situation — "knitting kit for kids" either does not match the product or the listing is failing to convert this traffic. This is a money sink.

**Recommendation:** Check Data Dive to determine if rank has moved on "knitting kit for kids" — if yes, document the rank benefit before pausing. If rank has not moved, pause this campaign immediately. Review listing relevance to the "kids" positioning — if the product doesn't clearly target kids, this keyword will never convert. Budget of $20/day makes this especially costly to leave running.

### 6. cat knitting - SPM SK knitting beginner kit TOS — HEALTHY

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Single Keyword / TOS | — |
| Spend | $5.83 (2.4% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 21.61% | Below Growth target — Good |
| CVR | 9.09% (1/11) | Near 10% — Acceptable for new campaign |
| CPC | $0.53 | — |
| CTR | 1.66% | — |
| Orders | 1 | — |
| Sales | $26.98 | — |
| Budget | $15.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~6 weeks (started 1/7/26) | — |

**Assessment:** Promising early-stage campaign. ACoS of 21.61% is well within Growth targets. CVR of 9.09% from 11 clicks is a positive signal for a 6-week-old campaign — small sample but trending right. The TOS IS is low (<5%), suggesting bids may not be high enough to capture the top placement consistently.

**Recommendation:** Monitor for 2-3 more weeks to build sample size. If CVR stays near or above 9%, consider a moderate bid increase to improve TOS IS and push more impressions. This campaign is the right approach — keep it running and give it room to develop.

### 7. cat knitting - SPM SK loom kit for kids TOS — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Single Keyword / TOS | — |
| Spend | $3.36 (1.4% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | — |
| CVR | 0% (0/4) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.84 | — |
| CTR | 2.07% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $8.50/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~3 months (started 11/20/25) | — |

**Assessment:** 4 clicks, 0 orders, ~3 months running. At 3 months this is past the "needs more data" window. "Loom kit for kids" — verify this term is relevant to the product. Low spend so financial impact is limited, but it's providing no value. CTR of 2.07% is decent, suggesting impressions are somewhat targeted, but clicks are not converting.

**Recommendation:** Pull the search term data. If "loom kit for kids" is genuinely relevant, give it a small bid test to increase impressions and clicks before concluding it doesn't work. If it's not relevant to your product, pause. Set a decision point: if no orders after next review cycle, pause.

### 8. cat knitting - SPM other root TOS — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | TOS | — |
| Spend | $2.91 (1.2% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | — |
| CVR | 0% (0/7) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.42 | — |
| CTR | 1.46% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $20.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~6 months (started 8/11/25) | — |

**Assessment:** 7 clicks, 0 orders over the 7-day window. Campaign is 6 months old. The $20/day budget suggests this was set up with significant intent, but current performance doesn't justify that allocation — it is severely underdelivering against budget (spending only ~$0.42/day). "Other root" terminology in the name suggests this may be a keyword grouping campaign that hasn't found its terms.

**Recommendation:** Pull the search term report. If terms are broadly irrelevant, restructure the keyword list or pause. The $20/day budget is disproportionate to actual spend — either the bids are too low or the keywords are too niche/irrelevant. Clarify the purpose of this campaign in the broader TOS strategy.

### 9. cat knitting - SPM SK loom animals kit for kids TOS — TOP PERFORMER

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | Single Keyword / TOS | — |
| Spend | $2.83 (1.1% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | 12.32% | Well Below target — Excellent |
| CVR | 33.33% (1/3) | Well Above 10% — Excellent |
| CPC | $0.94 | — |
| CTR | 6.82% | — |
| Orders | 1 | — |
| Sales | $22.98 | — |
| Budget | $14.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | 35.29% | Strong |
| Age | ~3 months (started 11/20/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Sample size is tiny (3 clicks) so CVR of 33% should be interpreted cautiously, but every signal here is positive — low ACoS, high CTR (6.82%), strong TOS IS (35.29%), and a conversion on a relevant-looking keyword. This campaign is severely under-spending relative to its $14/day budget, meaning bids are likely too low to win more auctions.

**Recommendation:** Raise bids to increase impression and click volume. Check Data Dive to confirm rank is moving on "loom animals kit for kids" — if rank is improving, this is exactly the kind of TOS campaign worth investing in. Flag for closer monitoring next review cycle as sample size grows.

### 10. cat knitting - SPM knitting kit for beginners TOS — WATCH

| Metric | Value | vs. Target |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Type | TOS (Single Keyword) | — |
| Spend | $0.35 (0.1% of portfolio) | — |
| ACoS | N/A (0 orders) | — |
| CVR | 0% (0/1) | Below 10% |
| CPC | $0.35 | — |
| CTR | 0.87% | — |
| Orders | 0 | — |
| Sales | $0.00 | — |
| Budget | $15.00/day | — |
| TOS IS | <5% | — |
| Age | ~6 months (started 8/11/25) | — |

**Assessment:** Extremely low spend — 1 click in 7 days from a $15/day budget. Campaign is 6 months old with virtually no delivery. This is severe under-bidding or keyword irrelevance. At this activity level it provides no usable data and no value.

**Recommendation:** Either significantly raise bids to generate meaningful traffic for evaluation, or pause this campaign. Leaving an ENABLED campaign at this activity level for 6 months is a structural problem — make a decision on it this review cycle.

## Dormant Campaigns (ENABLED but no activity)

| Campaign | Budget | Start Date | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|------------|----------------|
| cat knitting - SPM knitting kit root TOS | $7.00/day | 8/11/25 | 6 months old, 18 impressions, 0 clicks. Bids are too low to win any auctions. Either raise bids significantly to test relevance or pause — this campaign provides no data at current state. |
| cat knitting - SPM knitting kit for kids ages 8-12 TOS | $11.00/day | 8/11/25 | 6 months old, 4 impressions, 0 clicks. Same situation as above. "Ages 8-12" is a specific demographic — if the product targets this group, raise bids. If not, pause. |

---

## Structure Check

| Required Type | Present? | Campaign | Status |
|--------------|----------|----------|--------|
| Auto (SPA) | Yes | cat knitting - SPA auto | Healthy — top performer, budget-limited |
| Broad (SPM Broad) | Yes | cat knitting - SPM broad | Needs work — ACoS 56%, requires bid reduction and negative keyword work |
| Product Targeting (PAT) | Yes | cat knitting - SPM product targeting | Needs monitoring — ACoS slightly above target |
| Single Keyword (SK) | Yes | Multiple SK/TOS campaigns | Mixed — some healthy (SK knitting beginner kit), some under-performing (SK loom knitting kit) |
| Multi Keyword (MK) | No | Missing | Not identified — consider building from Auto search term winners |

**Gaps:**

1. **Auto campaign is budget-starved** — the portfolio's #1 performer is capped at $6/day. This is the most impactful structural fix available.
2. **TOS campaign overload** — 7+ TOS campaigns with most showing zero conversions. Consolidate to 2-3 proven TOS terms. Cut the rest or restructure.
3. **No MK campaign** — once top search terms are identified from Auto and Broad reports, building a multi-keyword SP campaign would add structure efficiency.
4. **Broad campaign not generating negative list** — at 6 months old with ACoS of 56%, the search term report should have already been mined for negatives. If this hasn't been done, it is the single highest-impact action available.

---

## Summary

**What's working:**
- The Auto campaign (SPA) is a standout performer at ACoS 6.95% and CVR 15.58%, generating 55% of portfolio sales on only 12.8% of spend — it should be the budget priority.
- SK loom animals kit for kids TOS is showing early strong signals (ACoS 12.32%, CTR 6.82%, 35% TOS IS) — a candidate to scale carefully.

**What needs attention:**
- SPM Broad is consuming 35.5% of budget at ACoS 56.29% — this is the portfolio's most urgent problem. Aggressive bid reduction and negative keyword work here will have the biggest immediate impact on portfolio ACoS.
- SK loom knitting kit TOS is spending $49.82 at 184.66% ACoS — the second-largest spend campaign is producing near-zero returns. Pause or significantly restructure.

**Quick wins:**
1. Increase Auto campaign budget from $6/day to $20/day — this alone could materially improve sales volume with minimal ACoS risk.
2. Pause `cat knitting - SPM SK loom knitting kit TOS` immediately to stop the $49.82 weekly bleed at 185% ACoS.

**Data Dive checks needed:**
- `cat knitting - SPM SK loom knitting kit TOS` — check if rank is moving on "loom knitting kit" before pausing (only justification for 185% ACoS is rank progress)
- `cat knitting - SPM knitting kit for kids TOS` — check rank movement on "knitting kit for kids" before pausing (29% TOS IS suggests strong placement, but zero conversions over 6 months is hard to justify)
- `cat knitting - SPM SK loom animals kit for kids TOS` — verify rank movement on "loom animals kit for kids" to confirm the case for scaling bids
- `cat knitting - SPM other root TOS` — clarify what keywords are actually running in this campaign and whether any rank movement justifies continued spend
