## Image-by-Image Detail

### Image 1: Hero Shot (Main Image)

**Image Type:** Product-only on white background
**Customer Question:** "What does this product look like?"

**Text on This Image:**

| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| *(none)* | Amazon requires no text/graphics on main image | — |

**Why this copy:** Amazon TOS requires clean white background, no text overlays on Image 1.

**Visual Elements:**
- Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF)
- Product: Gift box angled ~30 degrees, lid slightly open to reveal the heart-shaped canvas and colorful yarn visible inside
- The Barbie logo and branding on the box should be clearly visible
- Latch hook tool placed beside the box
- Show a glimpse of the vibrant pink/multi-color yarn

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- Hero image should make the Barbie branding IMMEDIATELY recognizable at thumbnail size
- The gift box itself is a selling point — show it prominently
- Ensure the heart shape of the canvas is visible (differentiator vs rectangular competitors)
- Bright, even lighting — no shadows that obscure product details

---

### Image 2: What's Included (Kit Contents)

**Image Type:** Flat-lay infographic
**Customer Question:** "What's included? Do I need to buy anything else?"

**Text on This Image:**

| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Complete Barbie Latch Hook Kit — Nothing Extra to Buy" | Top center, bold |
| Callout 1 | "Heart-Shaped Canvas with Printed Color Pattern" | Arrow pointing to canvas |
| Callout 2 | "Precut Multi-Color Yarn Bundles" | Arrow pointing to yarn |
| Callout 3 | "Latch Hook Tool" | Arrow pointing to hook |
| Callout 4 | "4.2 oz Soft Polyfill Stuffing" | Arrow pointing to stuffing |
| Callout 5 | "Step-by-Step Illustrated Instructions" | Arrow pointing to booklet |
| Badge | "All-In-One Kit" | Top right corner |

**Why this copy:** "What's included?" is the #1 most-asked question across ALL latch hook kit Q&A sections. Competitor LatchKits gets complaints about missing items (especially stuffing). Explicitly listing every component and stating "nothing extra to buy" removes the biggest purchase barrier.

**Visual Elements:**
- Background: Light pink or Barbie-themed gradient
- All kit components laid out neatly in a flat-lay arrangement
- Heart-shaped canvas as the centerpiece
- Yarn bundles arranged by color around the canvas
- Gift box visible but off to the side (this image is about contents, not packaging)

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- Each component clearly separated with breathing room
- Arrows/callout lines in Barbie pink
- Text in clean sans-serif font (legible at thumbnail)
- Ensure yarn colors are vibrant and accurate (addresses LatchKits "colors didn't match" complaint)

### Image 3: How It Works (Process)

**Image Type:** Step-by-step infographic with lifestyle elements
**Customer Question:** "Is this easy enough for my child? How does latch hooking work?"

**Text on This Image:**

| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "3-Step Latch Hook — Loop, Hook, Pull" | Top center |
| Step 1 | "1. Loop yarn around hook" | Left panel |
| Step 2 | "2. Push hook through canvas hole" | Center panel |
| Step 3 | "3. Pull yarn through — done!" | Right panel |
| Supporting | "Color-Coded Canvas — No Guessing" | Bottom left |
| Supporting | "Precut Yarn — No Measuring" | Bottom center |
| Supporting | "Kids Learn in Minutes" | Bottom right |

**Why this copy:** Parents worry about difficulty. LatchKits gets complaints about confusing color placement ("had to guess on some squares"). Showing a simple 3-step process with "no guessing" and "no measuring" removes the #2 purchase barrier (difficulty). "Learn in minutes" sets realistic expectations.

**Visual Elements:**
- 3-panel layout showing the loop-hook-pull process
- Close-up of child's hands (age 7-9) performing each step on the Barbie canvas
- Bright, well-lit photography
- Bottom section shows the color-coded canvas pattern close-up

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- Hands should look like a real child's (not adult hands)
- Canvas detail must show color-coding clearly
- Each step panel should be clear enough to understand even without text
- Barbie pink color scheme in the design elements

### Image 4: Finished Result

**Image Type:** Lifestyle / result showcase
**Customer Question:** "What does the finished pillow look like? Is it a real pillow?"

**Text on This Image:**

| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Heart Pillow Kids Make and Keep" | Top center |
| Callout 1 | "Soft, Stuffed, and Display-Ready" | Below headline |
| Callout 2 | "Bedroom Decor or Handmade Gift" | Bottom center |
| Badge | "Barbie Design in Vibrant Pink" | Top corner |

**Why this copy:** Customers want to see the finished product before buying. "Make and Keep" uses customer language — kids want to display their work. "Stuffed" differentiates from LatchKits wall hangings that aren't pillows. "Bedroom Decor or Handmade Gift" gives the buyer TWO use cases for the finished product.

**Visual Elements:**
- Finished Barbie heart pillow displayed on a child's bed or reading nook
- Bright, pink-themed bedroom setting
- Pillow should look plush, professional, and vibrant
- Child (age 7-9) holding or hugging the finished pillow, showing pride
- Barbie-themed room elements in background (subtle, not distracting)

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- Lifestyle setting — this is NOT a product-on-white image
- Pillow must look "real" — stuffed, dimensional, high quality
- Show scale against familiar objects (bed, child's arms)
- Warm, happy lighting — aspirational but achievable
- The finished heart shape should be the clear focal point

### Image 5: Age and Skill Level

**Image Type:** Infographic with lifestyle element
**Customer Question:** "What age is this for? Is it safe? Does my child need experience?"

**Text on This Image:**

| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Beginner Latch Hook Kit — Ages 6+" | Top center |
| Callout 1 | "No Sewing Required" | Left side, with icon |
| Callout 2 | "No Prior Experience Needed" | Center, with icon |
| Callout 3 | "Safe Rounded Hook Tool" | Right side, with icon |
| Supporting | "Color-by-Number Simplicity" | Below callouts |

**Why this copy:** "What age?" and "Is it safe?" are the #2 and #3 most-asked Q&A themes for kids' latch hook kits. Parents of 6-year-olds need reassurance. "No sewing" differentiates from other craft kits in the broader market. "Color-by-number simplicity" uses a familiar reference point every parent understands — instant comprehension of difficulty level.

**Visual Elements:**
- Split composition: child (age ~7) crafting on one side, close-up of the rounded hook tool on the other
- Three icon-text blocks for the three reassurance points
- The hook close-up should clearly show the rounded, safe tip
- Canvas close-up showing the color-coded grid (visible pattern)

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- Age 6+ is the bottom of the range — use a child who looks ~7 (not too young, not too old)
- Hook tool must be visible enough to see it's safe (rounded, not sharp)
- Icons should be simple, clean, universally understood
- Barbie pink accent color on all design elements

### Image 6: Gift / Lifestyle

**Image Type:** Gift-focused lifestyle image
**Customer Question:** "Is this a good gift? Is the packaging nice?"

**Text on This Image:**

| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Barbie Gift Box — Ready to Wrap" | Top center |
| Callout 1 | "Birthday - Holiday - Rainy Day" | Below headline |
| Callout 2 | "Screen-Free Craft Activity" | Bottom left |
| Callout 3 | "Builds Focus and Fine Motor Skills" | Bottom right |

**Why this copy:** The buyer is typically a parent or grandparent purchasing a GIFT (from context/business.md customer avatar). "Ready to Wrap" is the exact phrase gift buyers search for. Listing three occasions expands the perceived use cases. "Screen-Free" is a top emotional trigger for parents — it's the reason they choose craft kits over toys.

**Visual Elements:**
- Gift-giving scene: wrapped or open gift box, child's excited reaction
- Birthday party setting OR holiday morning setting
- The Barbie gift box should look premium and giftable
- Background includes other gifts to contextualize it as a gift option
- Optional: wrapping paper, ribbon, birthday card nearby

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- This image sells the EXPERIENCE of giving, not the product details
- Emotional warmth is key — capture genuine joy
- Gift box should be the hero element
- Barbie branding visible on the box
- Can use split frame: wrapped gift + child crafting

### Image 7: Brand Trust + Barbie License

**Image Type:** Brand credibility infographic
**Customer Question:** "Is this real Barbie? Who makes it? Can I trust this brand?"

**Text on This Image:**

| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Officially Licensed Barbie Craft Kit" | Top center |
| Callout 1 | "The Only Barbie Latch Hook Kit Available" | Below headline |
| Callout 2 | "Iconic Barbie Design and Colors" | Center left |
| Callout 3 | "By Craftiloo — Trusted by 100K+ Customers" | Bottom center |
| Badge | Official Barbie / Mattel license mark | Top right corner |

**Why this copy:** Licensed products command higher trust and conversion. "The Only" creates urgency and exclusivity. "100K+ Customers" provides social proof. This image answers the skeptical buyer who sees "Barbie" in the title and wonders if it's genuinely licensed or a knockoff.

**Visual Elements:**
- Clean, premium layout with Barbie branding front and center
- Official Barbie/Mattel license logo or mark
- Craftiloo brand logo
- Product image with Barbie color scheme (iconic pink)
- Optional: collage of other Craftiloo products showing brand breadth

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- This is the trust-building image — clean, professional, authoritative
- Less lifestyle, more brand credibility
- White or light pink background for premium feel
- License marks and logos must be crisp and properly sized
- If Mattel provides co-branding guidelines, follow them exactly
