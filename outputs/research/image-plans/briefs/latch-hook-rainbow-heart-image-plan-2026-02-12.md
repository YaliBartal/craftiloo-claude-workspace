### Copy Guidelines Applied

- **Voice:** Informative, factual, listing-style. Same tone as the product bullet points. Written for the adult buyer (parent/grandparent), not the child.
- **Rufus optimization:** Every text block contains indexable keywords — "latch hook kit", "ages 6+", "pillow", "screen-free", "beginner", "no sewing", "gift-ready"
- **No kitschy language:** No "Easy as 1-2-3", no "The Perfect Gift", no "Loved by Kids". Instead: factual statements that answer questions and contain search terms.
- **Matches listing bullets:** Text mirrors the existing bullet style:
  - Listing says: *"Made for Beginners — Easy, Fun, and Frustration-Free"*
  - Image says: *"Beginner-Friendly — No Sewing Skills Needed"*
  - Listing says: *"All in One Kit — Open and Start Crafting"*
  - Image says: *"All-In-One Latch Hook Kit — No Extra Supplies Needed"*

## Image-by-Image Detail

---

### Image 1: Hero / Main Image

**Image Type:** Product on white (Amazon-compliant)
**Customer Question:** *"What does the finished pillow look like?"*

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| *(none)* | *(Amazon main image rule — no text, no logos, no graphics)* | — |

**Why no copy:** Amazon requirement. Main image must be product only on pure white background.

**Visual Elements:**
- Background: Pure white (RGB 255,255,255)
- Completed Rainbow Heart pillow, center frame, slightly angled to show dimension
- Pillow looks plump, stuffed, huggable
- Rainbow yarn colors vibrant and saturated
- Product fills 85%+ of frame

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- Shoot from 15-20 degree overhead angle to show heart shape
- Soft, even lighting — make yarn texture visible
- Product should look "finished by a kid" quality — attainable, not airbrushed
- Minimum 1,600px longest side for zoom
- Subtle shadow for depth

### Image 2: What's Included — Complete Kit Breakdown

**Image Type:** Flat-lay infographic with labeled components
**Customer Question:** *"What comes in the box? Do I need to buy anything else?"*

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Primary text | **"All-In-One Latch Hook Kit — No Extra Supplies Needed"** | Top, clear and readable |
| Callout 1 | "Pillow Base with Printed Color Grid" | Arrow/line to pillow base |
| Callout 2 | "Pre-Cut Yarn Bundles — No Measuring, No Cutting" | Arrow/line to yarn |
| Callout 3 | "Latch Hook Tool Included" | Arrow/line to tool |
| Callout 4 | "Soft Pillow Stuffing" | Arrow/line to stuffing |
| Callout 5 | "Step-by-Step Instruction Booklet" | Arrow/line to booklet |
| Callout 6 | **"Video Tutorial Guide Included"** | Highlighted with play icon — larger/bolder than other callouts |
| Bottom info | "Complete Kit — Open and Start Crafting" | Bottom center |

**Why this copy:** Mirrors listing bullet #3: *"All in One Kit — Open and Start Crafting. Everything You Need is inside."* Reviewer marilyn's top praise was *"All the pieces were there"* — confirming completeness is a real purchase concern. "No Extra Supplies Needed" directly answers the question. "Video Tutorial Guide Included" is our biggest differentiator — a frustrated LatchKits reviewer complained about *"no printed guide for each row"* — our video solves exactly that. NO competitor calls out video tutorials in their images.

**Visual Elements:**
- Background: Light gray or soft white
- All components in neat "knolling" flat-lay arrangement
- Yarn bundles fanned out to show full rainbow color range
- Each component clearly separated with breathing room

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- "Video Tutorial Guide Included" gets a play button icon — make it clearly distinct from other callouts
- Use Craftiloo brand colors for text/lines
- All text legible at mobile thumbnail size
- Text style should match the listing — clean, informative, no decorative fonts

### Image 3: How It Works — Beginner-Friendly Process

**Image Type:** Process infographic (3 panels)
**Customer Question:** *"Is this too hard for my child? What skill level is needed?"*

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Primary text | **"Beginner-Friendly — No Sewing Skills Needed"** | Top, clear |
| Panel 1 | "1. Loop the Yarn Through the Canvas" | Below first panel |
| Panel 2 | "2. Hook Through and Catch the Yarn" | Below second panel |
| Panel 3 | "3. Pull to Secure — That's It" | Below third panel |
| Supporting info | **"Includes Step-by-Step Video Tutorial"** | Bottom, with play button icon |
| Age info | "Suitable for Ages 6+" | Corner badge |

**Why this copy:** Mirrors listing bullet #1: *"Made for Beginners — Even first-timers can finish this latch hook pillow with ease. No sewing skills needed!"* Reviewer courtney price said her 6-year-old *"needed some assistance but after a while had no issues"* — so we state "Ages 6+" and provide the video tutorial as backup. The panel descriptions are factual — they describe what actually happens in each step, not cute labels. LatchKits uses "loop, hook, and pull" only in text — we're showing it visually AND adding the video tutorial advantage.

**Visual Elements:**
- Three side-by-side panels showing child's hands (age 8-10) on the canvas
- Panel 1: Yarn being placed through canvas mesh
- Panel 2: Latch hook pulling yarn through
- Panel 3: Completed loop, yarn secured
- Canvas shows partial progress (some sections filled, some empty)

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- Child model's hands — proves kids can do it
- Warm, natural lighting
- Clear panel separation
- Text should be the same clean, informative style as the listing

### Image 4: The Result — Finished Pillow in Use

**Image Type:** Lifestyle / result showcase
**Customer Question:** *"What does the finished result actually look like? Is it a real pillow?"*

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Primary text | **"Finished Latch Hook Pillow — Made Entirely by Your Child"** | Top or bottom, not competing with the photo |
| Supporting info | "Soft, Stuffed Pillow Kids Can Display in Their Room or Use Every Day" | Small, below primary text |

**Why this copy:** Factual statement about what the product becomes. Reviewer kassie said it's *"something I keep"* and she valued the finished product. Lissa Smith called it *"a cute pillow or shelf accent"* — confirming buyers want to know the result is real and usable. "Made Entirely by Your Child" addresses the pride/independence theme that appears in multiple reviews. This text is informative — it tells the buyer exactly what the end result is (a real, usable pillow) and who makes it (their child, independently).

**Visual Elements:**
- Setting: Cozy bedroom (bed, soft lighting)
- Child (age 8-10) holding finished pillow, genuine smile
- Pillow prominently visible and recognizable
- Warm, natural lighting
- Aspirational but relatable room setting

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- This is the key conversion image — the emotional proof for grandparents/parents
- Model must look genuinely happy, not posed
- **NO competitor in the entire category has a lifestyle image with a child** — this is the biggest gap
- Keep text minimal — the photo does the heavy lifting here
- The text just clarifies what the viewer is seeing (a finished pillow made by a kid)

### Image 5: Gift Suitability — Packaging and Occasions

**Image Type:** Gift/packaging info image
**Customer Question:** *"Is this appropriate as a gift? Does it come in presentable packaging?"*

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Primary text | **"Gift-Ready Packaging — Arrives Ready to Wrap"** | Top, clear |
| Info line 1 | "Complete Latch Hook Pillow Kit in Presentation Box" | Below primary text |
| Info line 2 | "Suitable for Birthdays, Christmas, Holidays, and Rainy Days" | Center or around box |
| Info line 3 | "Screen-Free Craft Activity for Ages 6+" | Below |
| Info line 4 | "No Extra Supplies Needed — Everything Included" | Bottom |

**Why this copy:** Directly mirrors listing bullet #5: *"Giftable, Educational, and Screen-Free. Perfect for birthdays, holidays, or rainy days. Arrives in a ready-to-wrap gift box."* 5 of 8 reviews explicitly describe this as a gift purchase — *"Best birthday gift!"*, *"Good child gift"*, *"gift for the great granddaughter for christmas"*. The text is purely informative: what the packaging is, what occasions it suits, what age it's for, and that it's complete. Rufus can index "gift-ready", "ages 6+", "screen-free", "birthdays", "Christmas".

**Visual Elements:**
- Center: Product gift box, slightly angled, looking clean
- Soft background, not overpowering
- Optional: subtle ribbon or gift tissue for context

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- Box must look clean and presentable
- Text laid out like product info, not a poster
- "Screen-Free Craft Activity" should be prominent — #1 trigger for gift-buying grandparents
- This image speaks directly to the gift buyer

### Image 6: Educational Value — Developmental Benefits

**Image Type:** Benefits infographic with icons
**Customer Question:** *"Is this good for my child's development? What skills does it build?"*

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Primary text | **"Screen-Free Activity That Develops Real Skills"** | Top, clear |
| Benefit 1 | "Develops Fine Motor Skills Through Yarn Work" | Icon + text |
| Benefit 2 | "Builds Focus and Patience — Multi-Session Project" | Icon + text |
| Benefit 3 | "Encourages Creative Expression and Color Matching" | Icon + text |
| Benefit 4 | "Supports Independent Play for Ages 6 and Up" | Icon + text |
| Bottom info | "Recommended by Parents and Teachers for Screen-Free Learning" | Bottom center |

**Why this copy:** Directly from listing bullet #5: *"These latch hook kits support fine motor skills, focus, and creativity — without screens."* Lissa Smith's review noted *"encourages artistic expression and hands-on skills"*. Kassie described it as *"a few days working on it a couple hours per day"* — hence "Multi-Session Project" honestly sets time expectations. Each benefit line is a complete, informative statement — not a 2-word label. Rufus can index "fine motor skills", "screen-free", "ages 6", "independent play". NO competitor communicates educational benefits visually.

**Visual Elements:**
- Central product image (small) surrounded by benefit icons in clean layout
- Brand colors, modern design
- "Screen-Free" benefit gets most prominent placement
- Icons: simple, clean, consistent style

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- All text readable at mobile thumbnail
- Icons should be informative, not decorative
- White or very light background
- Layout similar to how listing bullets are structured — clear, scannable

### Image 7: Available Designs — 3 Pillow Options

**Image Type:** Variation showcase
**Customer Question:** *"What other designs are available?"*

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Primary text | **"3 Latch Hook Pillow Designs Available"** | Top, clear |
| Label 1 | "Rainbow Heart Pillow" | Under first pillow |
| Label 2 | "Googly Eyes Heart Pillow" | Under second pillow |
| Label 3 | "Wise Owl Pillow" | Under third pillow |
| Supporting info | "Same Complete All-In-One Kit in Each Design" | Bottom center |
| Current indicator | "Currently Viewing: Rainbow Heart" | Small indicator near Rainbow Heart |

**Why this copy:** Purely informational — tells the customer exactly what's available. Lissa Smith's review mentioned wanting *"the option to choose the owl instead"* and L&C wished they'd chosen differently — proving customers browse variations. "Same Complete All-In-One Kit in Each Design" reassures that every variation has the same quality/contents. "Currently Viewing" orients the shopper. No marketing language — just what's available.

**Visual Elements:**
- Three finished pillows arranged clearly
- Rainbow Heart (current) slightly larger or center position
- Each pillow clearly labeled
- Clean, light background

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- All 3 pillows photographed in same style/lighting
- Simple current-listing indicator (arrow, border, or small highlight)
- This image helps Amazon surface variations and keeps shoppers in our product family

### Gaps We're Exploiting

1. **Lifestyle gap** — Zero competitors show a child with the product
2. **Information gap** — Zero competitors use informative text overlays
3. **Benefits gap** — Nobody communicates developmental skills visually
4. **Gift gap** — Nobody gives the gift buyer factual suitability info
5. **Tutorial gap** — Our video tutorials are unique but invisible in current images
6. **Variation gap** — Nobody shows their full design range in a single image
7. **Rufus gap** — No competitor has indexable text on images

### Current Image Audit

| # | Current | Problem | Replacement |
|---|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Completed pillow on white | Acceptable, could be more vibrant | Re-shoot with better styling |
| 2 | Flat lay of creation process | No labels, messy, doesn't answer "what's included" | Labeled kit infographic |
| 3 | Close-up of latch hook technique | Too zoomed in, no context, no text | 3-step process with descriptions |
| 4 | Finished pillow as static decor | No emotional connection, no child | Lifestyle with child |
| 5 | Vague detail shot | No clear purpose | Gift-ready packaging info |
| 6 | Vague detail shot | No clear purpose | Educational benefits infographic |
| 7 | Vague detail shot | No clear purpose | 3-design variation showcase |

**5 of 7 images need full replacement. Image 1 (hero) is acceptable but would benefit from a re-shoot.**
