| 2 | quilting | Fabric patchwork — no overlap with latch hook |
| 3 | weaving | Loom/thread craft — no overlap |
| 4 | macrame | Knotting craft — no overlap |
| 5 | diamond painting | Resin drill diamonds on canvas — different product |
| 6 | diamond art | Same as above — different material and technique |
| 7 | paint by number | Painting kit — no overlap |

## Negative EXACT Candidates

### Specific Irrelevant Products
> Product-specific negatives — this is a latch hook PILLOW kit, not a rug or wall hanging.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | latch hook rug | Product makes a pillow, not a rug |
| 2 | latch hook wall hanging | Product makes a pillow, not a wall hanging |
| 3 | latch hook rug kit | Kit for rug making — different end product |
| 4 | latch hook canvas | Looking for canvas only, not a complete kit |
| 5 | latch hook yarn only | Looking for yarn refill, not a complete kit |
| 6 | latch hook tool only | Looking for tool only, not a complete kit |

### Cross-Portfolio Terms [REVIEW]
> Terms that clearly belong to other Craftiloo portfolios. Negating as EXACT prevents cannibalization while preserving broad reach.

| # | Term | Belongs To | Why Consider |
|---|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | fuse beads kit | Fuse Beads portfolio | Completely different craft — prevents showing for fuse bead searches |
| 2 | embroidery kit for kids | Embroidery portfolio | Different craft type — customers looking for embroidery specifically |
| 3 | cross stitch kit | Cross Stitch portfolio | Different craft type — customers looking for cross stitch specifically |
| 4 | sewing kit for kids | Sewing portfolio | Different craft type — customers looking for sewing specifically |
| 5 | knitting kit for kids | Knitting portfolio | Different craft type — customers looking for knitting specifically |
| 6 | lacing cards | Lacing Cards portfolio | Completely different product type for younger children |

### Color/Attribute Modifiers
> Color terms that indicate the searcher wants a specific color product. Rainbow Heart uses rainbow colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, purple, pink, white) — those are PRESERVED. All other colors are negated.

## Flagged for Review [BORDERLINE]

| # | Term | Match Type | Concern |
|---|------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | toddler | Phrase | Product is 6+, but "toddler" could appear in relevant searches like "craft kits for toddlers and kids." Borderline — 6 is close to toddler age range end. |
| 2 | preschool | Phrase | Product is 6+, but some 5-year-olds in preschool could handle this with help. Borderline. |
| 3 | pre-k | Phrase | Same concern as preschool — borderline for 6+ product. |
| 4 | gold | Exact | Could indicate color preference OR material (gold-plated). Not in product design. Flag as potential false positive for "gold gift" searches. |
| 5 | silver | Exact | Same concern as gold — could mean color or material. Not in product design. |
| 6 | barbie | Phrase | Not a Barbie product. But Craftiloo has Barbie-licensed products in other categories — negating could block cross-discovery. |
| 7 | latch hook pillow kit for adults | Exact | Product targets kids 6+, but adults could purchase for themselves. Negating would lose legitimate adult buyers who want a beginner kit. |
