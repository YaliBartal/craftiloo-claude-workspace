| 10 | slime | Sensory play product — no overlap |
| 11 | tie dye | Fabric dyeing — no overlap |
| 12 | sewing machine | Product is hand-sewing, not machine sewing |
| 13 | scrapbook | Paper craft — no overlap |
| 14 | origami | Paper folding — no overlap |
| 15 | jewelry making | Different craft — product makes fairy figures, not jewelry |
| 16 | latch hook | Different needle craft — product is felt sewing, not latch hook |
| 17 | loom knitting | Yarn on loom — no overlap with felt sewing |
| 18 | punch needle | Textile art — different technique from felt sewing |

| 24 | candle making | Wax craft — no overlap |
| 25 | soap making | Chemical craft — no overlap |
| 26 | resin art | Epoxy resin — no overlap |

**NOT negating:**
- "embroidery" — Kit includes embroidery floss and needles; audience overlap with embroidery kits for kids
- "cross stitch" — Kit includes cross stitch needles; related needle craft with audience overlap
- "needlepoint" — Related needle craft, audience overlap
- "knitting" broadly — Some audience overlap with kids craft seekers
- "sewing" — That IS the product

### Wrong Product Types
> These share "sewing" category words but are completely different products.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | sewing machine | Hand-sewing kit, not a machine |
| 2 | serger | Industrial sewing machine type — not relevant |
| 3 | overlock | Machine sewing technique — not relevant |
| 4 | rotary cutter | Fabric cutting tool — not a craft kit |
| 5 | fabric bolt | Raw fabric yardage — not a craft kit |
| 6 | pattern paper | Sewing pattern drafting supply — not a kids kit |
| 7 | dress form | Garment display tool — not relevant |
| 8 | mannequin | Display tool — not relevant |
| 9 | seam ripper | Sewing tool only — not a craft kit |
| 10 | bobbin | Machine sewing part — not relevant |
| 11 | sewing table | Furniture — not relevant |
| 12 | embroidery machine | Machine embroidery equipment — not hand sewing |
| 13 | machine embroidery | Machine technique — not hand sewing |
| 14 | digitizing | Machine embroidery software — not relevant |

### Wrong Age Groups
> Searchers looking for different age groups than this product serves (ages 5-12).

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | baby | Product has needles — not safe for babies |
| 2 | infant | Same — not safe for infants |
| 3 | 18 month | Far too young for sewing with needles |

**NOT negating:**
- "toddler" — Close to lower age range (age 5). Lacing cards use "toddler sewing" as tracked keyword. [REVIEW]
- "adult" — Gift buyers ARE adults; negating would block parent/grandparent searches
- "preschool" — Age 5 is borderline preschool/kindergarten. [REVIEW]

> Searchers looking for non-product results.

| 17 | resale | Looking to resell, not end user |
| 18 | retail lot | Wholesale/bulk resale |
| 19 | used | Looking for secondhand product |
| 20 | secondhand | Looking for used product |
| 21 | second hand | Same as above |
| 22 | rental | Not a rental product |
| 23 | replacement parts only | Looking for spare parts, not full kit |

| 2 | sewing tote bag | Sewing storage accessory |
| 3 | sewing organizer | Storage/organization product |
| 4 | sewing basket | Storage product |
| 5 | sewing box adult | Adult sewing supply storage |
| 6 | sewing kit travel | Travel repair kit — not a kids craft kit |

| 8 | sewing machine for kids | Machine sewing — product is hand-sewing |
| 9 | felt sheets | Raw material only — product is a complete kit |
| 10 | felt fabric yard | Raw fabric yardage — not a kit |

### Cross-Portfolio Terms [REVIEW]

| # | Term | Belongs To | Why Consider |
|---|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | fuse beads kit | Fuse Beads portfolio | Wrong craft entirely — prevents cannibalization with own fuse bead products |
| 2 | latch hook kit | Latch Hook portfolio | Different craft — prevents cannibalization |
| 3 | embroidery kit for adults | 4 Flowers Embroidery portfolio | Wrong audience — this is a kids product |
| 4 | cross stitch sampler | Cross Stitch portfolio | Different product format |
| 5 | knitting kit for kids | Cat and Hat Knitting portfolio | Different craft — prevents cannibalization |
| 6 | lacing cards | Lacing Cards | Different product type — prevents cannibalization |

**Note:** Category 1 phrase negatives (fuse beads, latch hook, loom knitting, punch needle) already block most of these. Listed here for completeness.

### Color/Attribute Modifiers

**Preserved colors (fairy theme):**
- **pink** — Common fairy color, preserved
- **purple** — Common fairy color, preserved

**Flagged for review:**
- **gold** — Could indicate fairy wand/crown interest OR just a color [REVIEW]
- **silver** — Could indicate fairy sparkle interest OR just a color [REVIEW]

## Flagged for Review [BORDERLINE]

| # | Term | Match Type | Concern |
|---|------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | toddler | Phrase | Product is ages 5-12. Age 5 is borderline toddler. "Toddler sewing" is a tracked keyword for lacing cards — negating as phrase could block lacing card traffic if campaigns share structure. |
| 2 | preschool | Phrase | Age 5 is kindergarten/preschool age. Could block relevant gift-buyer searches for youngest end of age range. |
| 3 | gold | Phrase (color) | Could indicate fairy theme interest (gold wands, crowns). Or could be irrelevant color search. |
| 4 | silver | Phrase (color) | Could indicate fairy sparkle/wing interest. Or irrelevant color search. |
| 5 | barbie | Phrase | Not a Barbie product. But Craftiloo IS launching Barbie sewing kits — negating could block future cross-sell. Consider only if fairy campaigns show high spend on "barbie" with zero orders. |

**Estimated impact:** The 26 wrong-craft-type phrase negatives will block hundreds of irrelevant search term variants (e.g., "crochet kit for kids", "diamond painting for kids", "fuse beads kit"). The 14 wrong-product-type phrases prevent "sewing machine" and equipment searches from triggering. The 67 color modifiers prevent color-specific searches that indicate single-item shopping rather than themed kit purchases. 23 competitor brands flagged for your review.
