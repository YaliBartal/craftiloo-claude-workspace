## Negative PHRASE Candidates

| 12 | scrapbook | Product is cross stitch felt kit, not scrapbooking |
| 13 | origami | Product is cross stitch felt kit, not origami |
| 14 | jewelry making | Product is cross stitch felt kit, not jewelry making |
| 15 | latch hook | Different sewing family craft — latch hook uses pre-cut yarn on canvas, not cross stitch on felt |
| 16 | locker hooking | Different sewing family craft — locker hooking uses yarn through canvas |
| 17 | punch needle | Different sewing family craft — punch needle uses a punch tool, not cross stitch needles |
| 18 | loom knitting | Different sewing family craft — loom knitting uses yarn on loom pegs |
| 19 | felt craft | Product uses felt as a substrate for cross stitch, but "felt craft" typically means cutting/gluing felt shapes — different product. [NOTE: monitor for false positives since product IS felt-based] |
| 20 | string art | Product is cross stitch felt kit, not string art with nails |
| 21 | candle making | Product is cross stitch felt kit, not candle making |
| 22 | soap making | Product is cross stitch felt kit, not soap making |
| 23 | resin art | Product is cross stitch felt kit, not resin art |
| 24 | fuse beads | Product is cross stitch felt kit, not fuse beads |

**NOT negating:**
- "embroidery" — Cross stitch and embroidery share significant audience overlap. Customers often search "embroidery kit for kids" when looking for cross stitch.
- "sewing" — Customers use "sewing" loosely for all needle crafts. "Sewing kit for kids" is a protected search term.
- "knitting" broadly — Only negating "loom knitting" specifically. General "knitting" could catch relevant broad searches.
- "needlepoint" — Close enough to cross stitch that audience overlap exists.

**SPECIAL NOTE on "felt craft":** This product IS a felt-based cross stitch kit, so "felt craft" is borderline. However, searchers typing "felt craft" typically want cut-and-glue felt kits (like felt animals, felt flowers), not cross stitch on felt. Flagged for review — monitor for false positives.

### Wrong Product Types
> These share category words but are completely different products.

| 15 | stabilizer | Machine embroidery supply — not a hand craft kit |
| 16 | embroidery thread cone | Industrial-size thread — not a craft kit |

| 18 | aida cloth only | Supply-only purchase — this is a complete kit using felt, not aida cloth |
| 19 | cross stitch frame stand | Accessory/stand — not a craft kit |

### Wrong Age Groups
> Searchers looking for different age groups than this product serves.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | toddler | Product is for ages 6+ — contains needles, not suitable for toddlers |
| 2 | baby | Product is for ages 6+ — contains small parts and needles, not for babies |
| 3 | infant | Product is for ages 6+ — contains small parts and needles, not for infants |
| 4 | 18 month | Product is for ages 6+ — far too young |

**NOT negating:**
- "adult" — Some parents craft with kids, and gift purchasers may use adult-oriented searches.
- "preschool" — [REVIEW] Product is 6+. Preschool is typically 3-5. A 5-year-old in preschool is borderline for this product, but most preschool searchers want ages 3-4. Flagged for review.

### Cross-Portfolio Terms [REVIEW]
| # | Term | Belongs To | Why Consider |
|---|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | fuse beads kit | Fuse Beads portfolio | Wrong craft entirely — prevents cannibalization |
| 2 | latch hook kit | Latch Hook portfolio | Wrong craft — different technique |
| 3 | knitting kit for kids | Knitting portfolio | Wrong craft — different technique |
| 4 | lacing cards for kids | Lacing Cards portfolio | Wrong craft — different product type |
| 5 | latch hook pillow kit | Latch Hook portfolio | Wrong product — makes pillows, not keychains |
| 6 | embroidery kit for adults | Embroidery (adult) portfolio | Wrong age targeting — this is for kids |

**Note:** Most of these should already be blocked by the phrase negatives in Category 1 (fuse beads, latch hook, loom knitting). Listed here for completeness.

### Competitor Brand Terms (Human Decision Required)

| # | Brand | Recommendation |
|---|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Kraftlab | [REVIEW] Direct competitor — craft kits for kids. Keep unless search term data shows high spend + 0 orders |
| 2 | Fanzbo | [REVIEW] Direct competitor — craft kits. Same logic |
| 3 | Krafun | [REVIEW] Direct competitor — craft kits. Same logic |
| 4 | Azerka | [REVIEW] Direct competitor — craft kits. Same logic |
| 5 | KLUTZ | [REVIEW] Direct competitor — well-known craft kit brand. May drive high-intent traffic |
| 6 | Melissa and Doug | [REVIEW] Large kids brand — high brand loyalty, may waste spend |
| 7 | Creativity for Kids | [REVIEW] Direct competitor — kids craft kits. Brand searchers may convert |
| 8 | Hapinest | [REVIEW] Kids crafts — similar audience |
| 9 | IQKidz | [REVIEW] Kids crafts — similar audience |
| 10 | Made By Me | [REVIEW] Kids crafts — similar audience |
| 11 | FUNiOi | [REVIEW] Kids crafts — similar audience |
| 12 | Olikraft | [REVIEW] Craft kits — similar audience |
| 13 | PREBOX | [REVIEW] Craft kits — similar audience |
| 14 | Granny Squirrel | [REVIEW] Craft kits — similar audience |
| 15 | S & E TEACHER'S EDITION | [REVIEW] Education crafts — overlapping audience |
| 16 | The Woobles | Consider negating as EXACT — crochet brand, different craft entirely |
| 17 | Crochetta | Consider negating as EXACT — crochet brand, different craft entirely |

## Flagged for Review [BORDERLINE]

| # | Term | Match Type | Concern |
|---|------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | preschool | Phrase | Product is 6+. Preschool is typically 3-5. A 5-year-old in preschool is one year below target. Some early 6-year-olds may still be in preschool/kindergarten transition. More borderline for this 6+ product than the 7+ Girls kit. |
| 2 | barbie | Phrase | This is NOT a Barbie product. However, Craftiloo has Barbie-branded products launching. Negating "barbie" prevents wasted spend on brand-specific searches, but could block if Barbie products share campaigns. **Recommend negating at campaign level only if this product has its own campaigns.** |
| 3 | gold | Exact | Unicorn horns are classically depicted as gold. "Gold unicorn cross stitch" could be a relevant search. Consider PRESERVING for this unicorn product specifically. |
| 4 | silver | Exact | "Silver unicorn" is a common fantasy variant. "Silver unicorn cross stitch" could be a relevant search. Consider PRESERVING for this unicorn product specifically. |
| 5 | felt craft | Phrase | Product IS a felt-based cross stitch kit. But "felt craft" typically means cut-and-glue felt projects (felt animals, felt flowers), not cross stitch on felt. Could block some relevant traffic if someone searches "felt craft kit for kids" and would accept this product. Monitor for false positives. |
| 6 | counted cross stitch | Exact | Product is stamped/printed on felt, not counted. However, many beginners don't distinguish between stamped and counted. Negating may block some naive searchers who would buy either. |
| 7 | adult | Phrase | Product is for kids 6+. But parents sometimes search with adult terms when gift-buying. Safer to NOT negate. |
| 8 | boy | Phrase | Product features unicorn theme which skews female. But boys enjoy unicorn crafts too. Do NOT negate — could block valid traffic. |

## Summary

| Category | Negative Phrase | Negative Exact | Flagged |
|----------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Wrong craft types | 27 | — | 1 |
| Wrong product types | 19 | — | 0 |
| Wrong age groups | 4 | — | 1 |
| Wrong intent | 26 | — | 0 |

**Estimated impact:** The 27 wrong-craft-type phrase negatives will block hundreds of irrelevant search term variants across all non-cross-stitch crafts. The 66 color modifiers prevent wasted spend on color-specific searches that don't match this unicorn-themed kit (while preserving pink, white, and purple). The 20 specific irrelevant exact terms include 5 unicorn-specific terms (stuffed animal, toy, plush, felt toy, figurine) that address the unicorn theme attracting non-craft-kit traffic. 17 competitor brands flagged for your review.

**KEY DIFFERENCES from Cross Stitch Girls (CS01):**
- **5 additional unicorn-specific exact negatives** (unicorn stuffed animal, unicorn toy, unicorn plush, felt unicorn toy, unicorn figurine) — the unicorn theme attracts toy/plush searchers
- **"blue" negated** — not a preserved color for this product (unicorn = pink/white/purple)
- **"gold" and "silver" stronger candidates to PRESERVE** — unicorn horns are classically gold, and silver unicorns are common fantasy variants
- **"felt craft" more borderline** — this product IS felt-based, making the "felt craft" negative riskier
