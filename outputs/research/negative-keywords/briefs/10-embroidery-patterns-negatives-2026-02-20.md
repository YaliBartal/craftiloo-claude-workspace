## Negative PHRASE Candidates

### Wrong Craft Types
> These are entirely different craft categories. Searchers for these will never buy this embroidery kit.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | crochet | Yarn/hook craft — completely different from hand embroidery |
| 2 | quilting | Fabric patchwork — different technique and product |
| 3 | weaving | Loom/thread craft — no overlap with embroidery kits |
| 4 | macrame | Knotting craft — no overlap |
| 5 | diamond painting | Resin drill diamonds on canvas — different product entirely |
| 6 | diamond art | Same as above — different material and technique |
| 7 | paint by number | Painting kit — no overlap with needle/thread embroidery |
| 8 | pottery | Clay/kiln craft — no overlap |
| 9 | clay | Modeling material — no overlap |
| 10 | slime | Sensory play product — no overlap |
| 11 | tie dye | Fabric dyeing — no overlap |
| 12 | scrapbook | Paper craft — no overlap |
| 13 | origami | Paper folding — no overlap |
| 14 | jewelry making | Beads/wire craft — no overlap |
| 15 | latch hook | Yarn/canvas craft — different from hand embroidery |
| 16 | locker hooking | Yarn craft — no overlap |
| 17 | loom knitting | Yarn on loom — no overlap with embroidery |
| 18 | fuse beads | Plastic beads ironed on pegboard — completely different |
| 19 | perler beads | Brand name for fuse beads — no overlap |
| 20 | melty beads | Synonym for fuse beads — no overlap |
| 21 | iron beads | Synonym for fuse beads — no overlap |
| 22 | felt craft | Felt-specific craft — not embroidery |
| 23 | string art | String/nail art — no overlap |
| 24 | candle making | Wax craft — no overlap |
| 25 | soap making | Chemical craft — no overlap |
| 26 | resin art | Epoxy resin — no overlap |
| 27 | punch needle | Different textile technique — uses different tools and produces different results |

**NOT negating:**
- "cross stitch" — embroidery and cross stitch share significant audience overlap; "cross stitch for kids 8-12" and "kids cross stitch kits ages 8-12" are protected terms
- "sewing" — customers use "sewing" loosely for all needle crafts; "sewing kit for kids" is a protected term
- "needlepoint" — related needle art with audience overlap; "needlepoint for kids ages 8-12" is a protected term
- "knitting" broadly — some beginner craft kit shoppers cross-browse

### Wrong Product Types
> These share embroidery-related words but are completely different products.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | embroidery machine | Industrial/home machine — not a hand embroidery kit |
| 2 | machine embroidery | Machine-based embroidery — completely different from hand embroidery |
| 3 | digitizing | Software process for machine embroidery files |
| 4 | embroidery software | Computer programs for machine embroidery designs |
| 5 | stabilizer | Machine embroidery backing material — not relevant to hand embroidery kit |
| 6 | embroidery thread cone | Industrial-quantity thread — not a kit product |
| 7 | sewing machine | Machine product — this is a hand embroidery kit |
| 8 | serger | Sewing machine type — no overlap |
| 9 | overlock | Sewing machine function — no overlap |
| 10 | rotary cutter | Fabric cutting tool — not relevant to embroidery kit |
| 11 | fabric bolt | Bulk fabric purchase — not a kit |
| 12 | pattern paper | Dressmaking supply — not relevant |
| 13 | dress form | Dressmaking mannequin — no overlap |
| 14 | mannequin | Display/dressmaking — no overlap |
| 15 | bobbin | Sewing machine component — not relevant to hand embroidery |
| 16 | sewing table | Furniture — not a craft kit |

### Wrong Age Groups
> Searchers looking for age groups outside this product's 7-13 target.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | toddler | Product is for ages 7-13 — requires fine motor skills beyond toddler ability |
| 2 | baby | Product is for ages 7-13 — not a baby product, contains needles |
| 3 | infant | Product is for ages 7-13 — not an infant product |
| 4 | 18 month | Far too young for any embroidery kit |

**NOT negating:**
- "adult" — parents may search "adult and kid embroidery kit" or buy this alongside an adult kit
- "preschool" / "pre-k" [REVIEW] — product is 7+, but these terms are borderline (ages 5-6 could attempt with supervision)
- "kids" — this product TARGETS kids

### Wrong Intent
> Searchers looking for digital content, education services, or non-product results.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | free pattern | Looking for free digital content, not a physical kit |
| 2 | free download | Looking for free digital files |
| 3 | printable pattern | Looking for digital template, not physical product |
| 4 | digital pattern | Digital-only content |
| 5 | pdf pattern | Digital file download |
| 6 | ebook | Digital book, not physical kit |
| 7 | e-book | Same as above |
| 8 | online class | Education service, not product |
| 9 | virtual class | Education service, not product |
| 10 | workshop registration | Event registration, not product purchase |
| 11 | course enrollment | Education enrollment, not product |
| 12 | wholesale | Commercial buyer — different channel |
| 13 | bulk order | Commercial quantity — not retail purchase |
| 14 | commercial | Commercial/industrial use — not hobbyist |
| 15 | industrial | Industrial-scale — not a craft kit |
| 16 | professional grade | Professional supplies — this is a kids beginner kit |
| 17 | resale | Looking to resell, not end user |
| 18 | retail lot | Bulk resale quantity |
| 19 | used | Looking for secondhand product |
| 20 | secondhand | Looking for used product |
| 21 | second hand | Same as above |
| 22 | rental | Looking to rent, not buy |
| 23 | replacement parts only | Looking for spare parts, not full kit |
| 24 | repair kit | Looking for repair supplies, not craft kit |
| 25 | spare parts | Looking for components only |
| 26 | refill only | Looking for refill supplies only |

## Negative EXACT Candidates

### Specific Irrelevant Products
| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | embroidery thread only | Searching for thread supply, not a complete kit |
| 2 | embroidery hoop only | Searching for hoop supply, not a complete kit |
| 3 | embroidery fabric only | Searching for blank fabric, not a kit with patterns |
| 4 | embroidery scissors | Searching for a tool, not a kit |
| 5 | embroidery frame floor stand | Searching for furniture/stand, not a kit |
| 6 | embroidery hoop stand | Searching for stand/holder, not a kit |
| 7 | cross stitch wall art framed | Searching for finished/framed piece, not a kit to make |
| 8 | counted cross stitch advanced | Advanced level — this is a kids beginner kit |

### Cross-Portfolio Terms [REVIEW]
| # | Term | Belongs To | Why Consider |
|---|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | fuse beads kit | Fuse Beads portfolio | Wrong craft entirely — prevents cannibalization between Craftiloo portfolios |
| 2 | latch hook kit | Latch Hook portfolio | Different craft type — customer looking for yarn/canvas kit |
| 3 | lacing cards for kids | Lacing Cards portfolio | Different product type — motor skill cards for younger kids |
| 4 | knitting kit for kids | Knitting portfolio | Different craft type — yarn/loom product |

**Note:** These should already be blocked by the Category 1 phrase negatives (latch hook, fuse beads, loom knitting). Listed here as exact matches for completeness.

### Color/Attribute Modifiers
> Color terms that indicate the searcher wants a specific single-color item. Embroidery kits = negate most colors. Customers search by design theme, not thread color. This kit has 10 varied designs — no single-color identity.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|

| 2 | ash | Color modifier — not relevant to multi-pattern kids kit |
| 3 | beige | Color modifier — not relevant |
| 4 | black | Color modifier — not relevant |
| 5 | blue | Color modifier — not relevant |

## Flagged for Review [BORDERLINE]

| # | Term | Match Type | Concern |
|---|------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | preschool | Phrase | Product is 7+, but preschool is typically ages 3-5. Negating is likely safe but could block a parent searching "preschool to school age embroidery" — unlikely scenario. |
| 2 | pre-k | Phrase | Same concern as preschool. Ages 4-5 are below the 7+ target. Likely safe to negate. |
| 3 | gold | Exact | Could indicate color preference or metallic thread preference. Multi-design kit unlikely to match. Flag for review. |
| 4 | silver | Exact | Could indicate color preference or metallic thread preference. Same concern as gold. |
| 5 | adult | Phrase | NOT recommended to negate — parents search "adult and kid embroidery kit" or browse adult kits while shopping for kids. But this is a kids product, so some adult-only searches will waste spend. |
| 6 | barbie | Phrase | Not a Barbie product. But Craftiloo has Barbie-branded products in other categories — negating here could conflict if Barbie embroidery launches later. |
| 7 | punch needle | Phrase | Listed as wrong craft type, but some beginner needle-art parents may cross-browse for kids. Currently negated above — confirm. |
