**NOT negating:**
- "embroidery" — Cross stitch and embroidery share significant audience overlap. Customers often search "embroidery kit for kids" when looking for cross stitch.
- "sewing" — Customers use "sewing" loosely for all needle crafts. "Sewing kit for kids" is a protected search term.
- "knitting" broadly — Only negating "loom knitting" specifically. General "knitting" could catch relevant broad searches.
- "needlepoint" — Close enough to cross stitch that audience overlap exists.

### Wrong Product Types

| 15 | stabilizer | Machine embroidery supply — not a hand craft kit |

| 18 | aida cloth only | Supply-only purchase — this is a complete kit |
| 19 | cross stitch frame stand | Accessory/stand — not a craft kit |

### Wrong Age Groups
> Searchers looking for different age groups than this product serves.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | toddler | Product is for ages 7-13 — needles are inappropriate for toddlers |
| 2 | baby | Product is for ages 7-13 — contains small parts, not for babies |
| 3 | infant | Product is for ages 7-13 — contains small parts, not for infants |
| 4 | 18 month | Product is for ages 7-13 — far too young |

**NOT negating:**
- "adult" — Some parents craft with kids, and adult cross stitch searchers may buy for gifting.
- "preschool" — [REVIEW] Product is 7+, preschool is typically 3-5. Could negate, but some 6-year-olds are in preschool. Flagged for review.

### Cross-Portfolio Terms [REVIEW]
| # | Term | Belongs To | Why Consider |
|---|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | fuse beads kit | Fuse Beads portfolio | Wrong craft entirely — prevents cannibalization |
| 2 | latch hook kit | Latch Hook portfolio | Wrong craft — different technique |
| 3 | knitting kit for kids | Knitting portfolio | Wrong craft — different technique |
| 4 | lacing cards for kids | Lacing Cards portfolio | Wrong craft — different product type |
| 5 | latch hook pillow kit | Latch Hook portfolio | Wrong product — makes pillows, not keychains |
| 6 | embroidery kit for adults | Embroidery (adult) portfolio | Wrong age targeting — this is for kids |

**Note:** Most of these should already be blocked by the phrase negatives in Category 1 (fuse beads, latch hook, loom knitting). Listed here for completeness.

### Competitor Brand Terms (Human Decision Required)

| # | Brand | Recommendation |
|---|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Kraftlab | [REVIEW] Direct competitor — craft kits for kids. Keep unless search term data shows high spend + 0 orders |
| 2 | Fanzbo | [REVIEW] Direct competitor — craft kits. Same logic |
| 3 | Krafun | [REVIEW] Direct competitor — craft kits. Same logic |
| 4 | Azerka | [REVIEW] Direct competitor — craft kits. Same logic |
| 5 | KLUTZ | [REVIEW] Direct competitor — well-known craft kit brand. May drive high-intent traffic |
| 6 | Melissa and Doug | [REVIEW] Large kids brand — high brand loyalty, may waste spend |
| 7 | Creativity for Kids | [REVIEW] Direct competitor — kids craft kits. Brand searchers may convert |
| 8 | Hapinest | [REVIEW] Kids crafts — similar audience |
| 9 | IQKidz | [REVIEW] Kids crafts — similar audience |
| 10 | Made By Me | [REVIEW] Kids crafts — similar audience |
| 11 | FUNiOi | [REVIEW] Kids crafts — similar audience |
| 12 | Olikraft | [REVIEW] Craft kits — similar audience |
| 13 | PREBOX | [REVIEW] Craft kits — similar audience |
| 14 | Granny Squirrel | [REVIEW] Craft kits — similar audience |
| 15 | S & E TEACHER'S EDITION | [REVIEW] Education crafts — overlapping audience |
| 16 | The Woobles | Consider negating as EXACT — crochet brand, different craft entirely |
| 17 | Crochetta | Consider negating as EXACT — crochet brand, different craft entirely |

## Flagged for Review [BORDERLINE]

| # | Term | Match Type | Concern |
|---|------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | preschool | Phrase | Product is 7+, preschool is typically 3-5. But some 5-6 year olds may be in preschool and could use simpler designs. Safer to negate for this 7+ product. |
| 2 | barbie | Phrase | This is NOT a Barbie product. However, Craftiloo has Barbie-branded products launching. Negating "barbie" prevents wasted spend on brand-specific searches, but could block if Barbie products share campaigns. **Recommend negating at campaign level only if this product has its own campaigns.** |
| 3 | gold | Exact | Could indicate "gold thread" which some embroidery floss kits include. But more likely indicates a color preference for a gold-themed product. Low risk to negate. |
| 4 | silver | Exact | Same logic as gold — could mean silver thread but more likely color preference. Low risk to negate. |
| 5 | counted cross stitch | Exact | Product is STAMPED, not counted. However, many beginners don't distinguish between stamped and counted. Negating may block some naive searchers who would buy either. |
| 6 | adult | Phrase | Product is for kids 7-13. But parents sometimes search "adult and kids cross stitch" or gift purchasers use adult-oriented searches. Safer to NOT negate. |
| 7 | boy | Phrase | Product imagery targets girls (heart, unicorn, cats, rainbow, owl). But many boys enjoy these crafts too. Do NOT negate — could block valid traffic. |
