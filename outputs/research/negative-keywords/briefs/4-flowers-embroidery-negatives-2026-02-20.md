## Negative PHRASE Candidates

### Wrong Craft Types

| 2 | quilting | Fabric patchwork — different technique and product |
| 3 | weaving | Loom/thread craft — no overlap with embroidery kits |
| 4 | macrame | Knotting craft — no overlap |
| 5 | diamond painting | Resin drill diamonds on canvas — different product despite craft-kit similarity |
| 6 | diamond art | Same as above — different material and technique |
| 7 | paint by number | Painting kit — no overlap with needle/thread embroidery |
| 8 | pottery | Clay/kiln craft — no overlap |

| 26 | resin art | Epoxy resin — no overlap |
| 27 | punch needle | Different textile technique — uses different tools and produces different results |

**NOT negating:**

- "needlepoint" — related needle art with audience overlap
- "knitting" broadly — some beginner craft kit shoppers cross-browse

### Wrong Product Types
> These share embroidery-related words but are completely different products.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | embroidery machine | Industrial/home machine — not a hand embroidery kit |
| 2 | machine embroidery | Machine-based embroidery — completely different from hand embroidery |
| 3 | digitizing | Software process for machine embroidery files |
| 4 | embroidery software | Computer programs for machine embroidery designs |
| 5 | stabilizer | Machine embroidery backing material — not relevant to hand embroidery kit |
| 6 | embroidery thread cone | Industrial-quantity thread — not a kit product |
| 7 | sewing machine | Machine product — this is a hand embroidery kit |
| 8 | serger | Sewing machine type — no overlap |

### Wrong Age Groups
> Searchers looking for age groups outside this product's teen/adult target.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | toddler | Product is for teens/adults — far too advanced for toddlers |
| 2 | baby | Product is for teens/adults — not a baby product |
| 3 | infant | Product is for teens/adults — not an infant product |
| 4 | 18 month | Far too young for any embroidery kit |
| 5 | preschool | Product requires fine motor skills — not suitable for preschool age |
| 6 | pre-k | Same as preschool — too young for hand embroidery |

**NOT negating:**
- "adult" — this product TARGETS adults
- "kids" [REVIEW] — could be teens searching; also parents may search "embroidery kit for kids" intending older kids/teens

### Wrong Intent

| 3 | printable pattern | Looking for digital template, not physical product |
| 4 | digital pattern | Digital-only content |

| 8 | online class | Education service, not product |
| 9 | virtual class | Education service, not product |
| 10 | workshop registration | Event registration, not product purchase |
| 11 | course enrollment | Education enrollment, not product |
| 12 | wholesale | Commercial buyer — different channel |
| 13 | bulk order | Commercial quantity — not retail purchase |
| 14 | commercial | Commercial/industrial use — not hobbyist |
| 15 | industrial | Industrial-scale — not a craft kit |
| 16 | professional grade | Professional supplies — this is a beginner kit |

## Negative EXACT Candidates

### Specific Irrelevant Products
| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | embroidery thread only | Searching for thread supply, not a complete kit |
| 2 | embroidery hoop only | Searching for hoop supply, not a complete kit |
| 3 | embroidery fabric only | Searching for blank fabric, not a kit with patterns |
| 4 | embroidery scissors | Searching for a tool, not a kit |
| 5 | embroidery frame floor stand | Searching for furniture/stand, not a kit |
| 6 | embroidery hoop stand | Searching for stand/holder, not a kit |
| 7 | cross stitch wall art framed | Searching for finished/framed piece, not a kit to make |
| 8 | counted cross stitch advanced | Advanced level — this is a beginner-focused kit |

### Cross-Portfolio Terms [REVIEW]
| # | Term | Belongs To | Why Consider |
|---|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | fuse beads kit | Fuse Beads portfolio | Wrong craft entirely — prevents cannibalization between Craftiloo portfolios |
| 2 | latch hook kit | Latch Hook portfolio | Different craft type — customer looking for yarn/canvas kit |
| 3 | lacing cards for kids | Lacing Cards portfolio | Different product type — motor skill cards for young kids |
| 4 | knitting kit for kids | Knitting portfolio | Different craft type — yarn/loom product |

**Note:** These should already be blocked by the Category 1 phrase negatives (latch hook, fuse beads, loom knitting). Listed here as exact matches for completeness.

### Color/Attribute Modifiers
> Color terms that indicate the searcher wants a specific single-color item. Embroidery kits = negate most colors. Customers search by design theme ("floral"), not thread color.

| # | Term | Why Negate |

| 1 | amethyst | Color modifier — product is floral multi-color kit, not single-color item |
| 2 | ash | Color modifier — not relevant to floral embroidery kit |
| 3 | beige | Color modifier — not relevant |
| 4 | black | Color modifier — not relevant to floral kit |

## Flagged for Review [BORDERLINE]

| # | Term | Match Type | Concern |
|---|------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | kids | Phrase | This product targets teens/adults, but "kids" could include older teens. Negating could block searches like "embroidery kit for older kids" that could convert. |
| 2 | gold | Exact | Could indicate color preference or metallic thread preference. Floral embroidery may use gold accents. Flag for review. |
| 3 | silver | Exact | Could indicate color preference or metallic thread preference. Same concern as gold. |
| 4 | punch needle | Phrase | Listed as wrong craft type, but some beginner needle-art shoppers cross-browse. Currently negated above — confirm. |
| 5 | Clever Poppy | Exact | Direct competitor in embroidery — "clever poppy embroidery kit" is a protected search term. Brand searches could convert if product is competitive. |
| 6 | barbie | Phrase | Not a Barbie product. But Craftiloo has Barbie-branded products in other categories — negating here could conflict if Barbie embroidery launches. |

The 16 wrong-product-type phrases prevent expensive machine-embroidery and sewing-machine traffic. The 67 color modifiers prevent single-color-item searches from triggering on this multi-design floral kit. 16 competitor brands flagged for your review — particularly Clever Poppy which appears directly in embroidery search terms.
