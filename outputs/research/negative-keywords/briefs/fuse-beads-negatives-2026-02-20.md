## Negative PHRASE Candidates

|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | crochet | Yarn/hook craft — completely different from fuse beads |
| 2 | knitting | Yarn/needle craft — no overlap with fuse beads |
| 3 | sewing | Needle/thread/fabric craft — no overlap |
| 4 | embroidery | Needle/thread on fabric — no overlap |
| 5 | cross stitch | X-pattern stitching on fabric — no overlap |
| 6 | latch hook | Yarn/canvas craft — no overlap |

| 13 | paint by number | Painting kit — no overlap |
| 14 | pottery | Clay/kiln craft — no overlap |
| 15 | clay | Modeling material — no overlap |

| 27 | resin art | Epoxy resin — no overlap |
| 28 | lacing cards | Threading/lacing activity — no overlap with fuse beads |
| 29 | mosaic tile | Tile/grout mosaic — different material despite similar concept |

### Wrong Product Types
> These share "bead" or related terms but are completely different products.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | bead loom | Weaving loom for seed beads — different craft entirely |
| 2 | seed beads | Tiny glass beads for jewelry — not fuse beads |
| 3 | jewelry beads | Beads for stringing/jewelry — not ironing |
| 4 | pony beads | Large plastic beads for stringing — not ironing |
| 5 | letter beads | Alphabet beads for bracelets — not ironing |
| 6 | water beads | Orbeez-type sensory beads — completely different |
| 7 | orbeez | Water bead brand — not fuse beads |
| 8 | pop beads | Snap-together beads for kids — not ironing |
| 9 | bead spinner | Jewelry making tool — not fuse beads |
| 10 | charm beads | Jewelry charms — not fuse beads |
| 11 | glass beads | Jewelry/decor beads — not fuse beads |
| 12 | wooden beads | Threading/jewelry beads — not fuse beads |
| 13 | bead bracelet | Jewelry product — not fuse bead art |
| 14 | bead necklace | Jewelry product — not fuse bead art |
| 15 | bead roller | Clay bead making tool — not fuse beads |
| 16 | bead reamer | Jewelry bead hole enlarger — not fuse beads |
| 17 | aqua beads | Water-activated beads (Aquabeads brand) — different product type |

### Wrong Age Groups
> Searchers looking for different age groups than fuse beads serve.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | baby | Fuse beads are choking hazard — minimum age 4 (standard) / 10 (mini) |
| 2 | infant | Same — unsafe for infants |
| 3 | toddler | Same — choking hazard for toddlers. Even standard 5mm beads are age 4+ minimum |
| 4 | 18 month | Far too young for any fuse beads |

**NOT negating:** "adult" (shinshin targets adults), "kids" (5mm standard beads target kids 5+), "preschool" [REVIEW — standard 5mm might be age 4-5]

### Wrong Intent
> Searchers looking for non-product results.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | free pattern | Looking for free digital content, not a physical kit |
| 2 | free download | Looking for free digital files |
| 3 | printable pattern | Looking for digital template, not physical product |
| 4 | digital pattern | Digital-only content |
| 5 | pdf pattern | Digital file |
| 6 | online class | Education, not product |
| 7 | virtual class | Education, not product |
| 8 | wholesale | Commercial buyer — different channel |
| 9 | resale | Looking to resell, not end user |
| 10 | secondhand | Looking for used product |
| 11 | second hand | Same |
| 12 | replacement parts only | Looking for spare parts, not full kit |

**NOT negating:** "bulk" (tracked keyword — "fuse beads bulk" is high-volume), "pattern" alone (kits include patterns), "refill" (large bead sets could serve as refills)

---

## Negative EXACT Candidates

### Specific Irrelevant Products

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | perler bead display | Looking for display/storage, not a crafting kit |
| 2 | bead organizer | Storage product, not a craft kit |
| 3 | bead storage container | Storage product |
| 4 | pegboard wall | Wall-mounted storage pegboard — not craft pegboard |
| 5 | peg board organizer | Wall organizer, not craft tool |
| 6 | bead curtain | Home decor product |
| 7 | perler bead wall art | Looking for finished art, not a kit to make it |
| 8 | fuse bead finished | Looking for pre-made finished products |

### High-Spend Zero-Order Terms (from search term report)

**Important note:** Most high-spend zero-order terms in this portfolio are actually **relevant** fuse bead terms (e.g., "fuse bead kit" $17.88, "mini perler beads kit" $12.05). These should NOT be negated — the conversion issue is likely competition/listing quality, not keyword relevance.

Only flagging terms that are genuinely questionable:

| # | Term | Spend | Clicks | Orders | Why Flag |
|---|------|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| 1 | fuse beads boards | $5.27 | 5 | 0 | May indicate searching for just pegboards, not full kit [REVIEW] |
| 2 | fuse beads iron | $4.94 | 5 | 0 | Could mean "fuse beads + iron tool" — not selling irons [REVIEW] |
| 3 | fuse beads refill | $3.36 | 2 | 0 | Refill implies they want loose beads only — but CC48 IS a large bead set [REVIEW] |
| 4 | tiny perler beads jewelry kit | $0.90 | 1 | 0 | Jewelry — wrong product type |
| 5 | fuse beads film | $2.09 | 1 | 0 | Unclear what "film" refers to — likely wrong product |

### Cross-Portfolio Terms [REVIEW]

| # | Term | Belongs To | Why Consider |
|---|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | sewing kit for kids | Sewing portfolios | Wrong craft entirely — but would only trigger in broad/auto |
| 2 | embroidery kit for kids | Embroidery portfolios | Wrong craft entirely |
| 3 | cross stitch kit | Cross Stitch portfolios | Wrong craft entirely |
| 4 | latch hook kit | Latch Hook portfolios | Wrong craft entirely |
| 5 | knitting kit for kids | Knitting portfolio | Wrong craft entirely |

**Note:** These should already be blocked by the Category 1 phrase negatives (sewing, embroidery, cross stitch, latch hook, knitting). Listed here for completeness only.

## Flagged for Review [BORDERLINE]

| # | Term | Match Type | Concern |
|---|------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | preschool | Phrase | Standard 5mm beads might be suitable for ages 4-5. But mini beads are 10+. Mixed age targeting in portfolio. |
| 2 | fuse beads boards | Exact | $5.27 spent, 0 orders. Could be searching for pegboards only OR full kit with boards. Craftiloo kits include boards. |
| 3 | fuse beads iron | Exact | $4.94 spent, 0 orders. Could mean "fuse beads + iron" (the tool) or "fuse beads to iron" (the activity). |
| 4 | fuse beads refill | Exact | $3.36 spent, 0 orders. Refill implies supplemental beads — CC48 with 24,000 beads could serve this need. |
| 5 | barbie | Phrase | Not a Barbie product. But fuse bead Barbie patterns exist — customers could make Barbie designs with any bead kit. |
| 6 | perler bead refill | Exact | Same logic as "fuse beads refill" — large bead sets serve as refills. |

## Safety Check Results

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Cross-referenced against search-terms.md | ✅ All 45+ tracked fuse bead terms (sections 2 & 2b) verified safe — none negated |
| Product title terms excluded | ✅ "fuse beads", "mini", "perler", "melty", "iron beads", "hama" all preserved |
| Own category terms preserved | ✅ All fuse bead category terms preserved |
| Brand terms preserved | ✅ "perler", "hama", "shinshin" preserved (category names, not just brands) |
| Competitor brands flagged | ✅ See below |

## Color/Attribute Modifiers

> **SKIPPED for Fuse Beads.** Fuse bead kits are multi-color products — customers search by color to find specific bead colors/refills (e.g., "blue fuse beads", "red perler beads"). Negating colors would block legitimate traffic.
>
> The 70-color TitanOS "Never KWs" list (amethyst through yellow) is **NOT applied** to this portfolio. It IS applied to single-design craft kits like cross stitch and embroidery.

**Special note:** "iron" appears in the color list but "iron beads" is a tracked keyword for fuse beads — correctly excluded.

## Competitor Brand Terms (Human Decision Required)

### Fuse Bead Category Brands (KEEP — category names)

| # | Brand | Recommendation |
|---|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Perler | Category name at this point. **Keep — NEVER negate.** |
| 2 | Hama | Category name at this point. **Keep — NEVER negate.** |
| 3 | Artkal | Fuse bead brand — shoppers may accept any compatible brand. **Keep** unless data shows high spend + 0 orders. |
| 4 | Nabbi | Fuse bead brand — same logic. **Keep.** |

### TitanOS Competitor Brands — Fuse Beads Relevance

| # | Brand | Relevant to Fuse Beads? | Recommendation |
|---|-------|------------------------|----------------|
| 1 | NBEADS | Yes — beading supplies | [REVIEW] Could overlap with fuse bead searches |
| 2 | The Woobles | No — crochet only | Consider negating as EXACT if showing in fuse bead campaigns |
| 3 | Crochetta | No — crochet only | Consider negating as EXACT |
| 4 | BeKnitting | No — knitting only | Consider negating as EXACT |
| 5 | AUTHENTIC KNITTING BOARD | No — knitting only | Consider negating as EXACT |
| 6 | Boye | No — knitting/crochet tools | Consider negating as EXACT |
| 7 | Mira HandCrafts | No — yarn/crafts | Consider negating as EXACT |
| 8 | Kraftlab | Maybe — general craft kits | [REVIEW] Keep unless data shows waste |
| 9 | Krafun | Maybe — general craft kits | [REVIEW] Keep unless data shows waste |
| 10 | Creativity for Kids | Maybe — kids crafts | [REVIEW] Keep unless data shows waste |

**Note:** Most TitanOS brands (52 total) are sewing/craft-kit focused and unlikely to trigger on fuse bead campaigns. Only brands listed above have meaningful overlap potential. Full competitor list maintained in `context/business.md`.
