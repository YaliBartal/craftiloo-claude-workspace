## Negative EXACT Candidates

### Specific Irrelevant Products
> Product-specific negatives — this is a latch hook PENCIL CASE kit, not a pillow, rug, or wall hanging.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | latch hook pillow | Product makes pencil cases, not pillows — different end product |
| 2 | latch hook rug | Product makes pencil cases, not a rug |
| 3 | latch hook wall hanging | Product makes pencil cases, not a wall hanging |
| 4 | latch hook rug kit | Kit for rug making — different end product |

### Cross-Portfolio Terms [REVIEW]
> Terms that clearly belong to other Craftiloo portfolios. Negating as EXACT prevents cannibalization while preserving broad reach.

| # | Term | Belongs To | Why Consider |
|---|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | fuse beads kit | Fuse Beads portfolio | Completely different craft — prevents showing for fuse bead searches |
| 2 | embroidery kit for kids | Embroidery portfolio | Different craft type — customers looking for embroidery specifically |
| 3 | cross stitch kit | Cross Stitch portfolio | Different craft type — customers looking for cross stitch specifically |
| 4 | sewing kit for kids | Sewing portfolio | Different craft type — customers looking for sewing specifically |
| 5 | knitting kit for kids | Knitting portfolio | Different craft type — customers looking for knitting specifically |
| 6 | lacing cards | Lacing Cards portfolio | Completely different product type for younger children |

### Color/Attribute Modifiers
> Color terms that indicate the searcher wants a specific color product. Pencil Cases kit uses Purple, Light Grey, Pink, Blue, Dark Grey — those base colors are PRESERVED (purple, grey, gray, pink, blue). All other colors are negated.

## Flagged for Review [BORDERLINE]

| # | Term | Match Type | Concern |
|---|------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | gold | Exact | Could indicate color preference OR material (gold-plated). Not in product design. Flag as potential false positive for "gold gift" searches. |
| 2 | silver | Exact | Same concern as gold — could mean color or material. Not in product design. |
| 3 | barbie | Phrase | Not a Barbie product. But Craftiloo has Barbie-licensed products in other categories — negating could block cross-discovery. |
| 4 | pencil case | Phrase | DO NOT negate — this IS the product. Listed here as a reminder that "pencil case" is a protected term for this product. |
| 5 | pencil pouch | Exact | Related to pencil cases but different product format. Could be a relevant search OR indicate a zipper pouch preference. Product does make a functional pencil case. [REVIEW — likely keep] |
| 6 | latch hook pillow kit for adults | Exact | Product targets kids 8-12, but adults could purchase for themselves. Different product type (pillow vs pencil case) makes this a likely negate. |

**Estimated impact:** The 24 wrong-craft-type phrase negatives block hundreds of irrelevant search term variants. The 17 wrong-product-type phrases prevent showing for sewing machine, embroidery machine, and supplies-only searches. The 64 color modifiers prevent showing for color-specific searches that don't match the pencil case design (more colors negated than Rainbow Heart since fewer product colors). The 6 age group negatives are stronger than Rainbow Heart because of the higher minimum age (8 vs 6). 4 exact negatives prevent pillow/rug/wall hanging searches from triggering on this pencil case product. 13 competitor brands flagged for your review.
