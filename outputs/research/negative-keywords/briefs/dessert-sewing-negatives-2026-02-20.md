## Negative PHRASE Candidates

### Wrong Craft Types
> Entirely different craft categories. Searchers for these will never buy this sewing kit.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | crochet | Yarn/hook craft — completely different from felt sewing |
| 2 | quilting | Fabric patchwork — not a kids felt sewing kit |
| 3 | weaving | Loom/thread craft — no overlap |
| 4 | macrame | Knotting craft — no overlap |
| 5 | diamond painting | Resin drill diamonds on canvas — different product |
| 6 | diamond art | Same as above — different material and technique |
| 7 | paint by number | Painting kit — no overlap |

| 10 | slime | Sensory play product — no overlap |
| 11 | tie dye | Fabric dyeing — no overlap |
| 12 | sewing machine | Product is hand-sewing, not machine sewing |
| 13 | scrapbook | Paper craft — no overlap |
| 14 | origami | Paper folding — no overlap |
| 15 | jewelry making | Different craft — product makes dessert charms, not traditional jewelry |
| 16 | latch hook | Different needle craft — product is felt sewing, not latch hook |
| 17 | loom knitting | Yarn on loom — no overlap with felt sewing |
| 18 | punch needle | Textile art — different technique from felt sewing |
| 19 | fuse beads | Plastic bead ironing craft — completely different |
| 20 | perler beads | Fuse bead brand name — completely different craft |
| 21 | melty beads | Fuse bead synonym — completely different craft |

| 23 | string art | String/nail craft — no overlap |
| 24 | candle making | Wax craft — no overlap |
| 25 | soap making | Chemical craft — no overlap |
| 26 | resin art | Epoxy resin — no overlap |

**NOT negating:**
- "embroidery" — Kit includes embroidery floss and needles; audience overlap with embroidery kits for kids
- "cross stitch" — Related needle craft with audience overlap
- "needlepoint" — Related needle craft, audience overlap
- "knitting" broadly — Some audience overlap with kids craft seekers
- "sewing" — That IS the product

### Wrong Product Types
> These share "sewing" category words but are completely different products.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | sewing machine | Hand-sewing kit, not a machine |
| 2 | serger | Industrial sewing machine type — not relevant |
| 3 | overlock | Machine sewing technique — not relevant |
| 4 | rotary cutter | Fabric cutting tool — not a craft kit |
| 5 | fabric bolt | Raw fabric yardage — not a craft kit |
| 6 | pattern paper | Sewing pattern drafting supply — not a kids kit |
| 7 | dress form | Garment display tool — not relevant |
| 8 | mannequin | Display tool — not relevant |
| 9 | seam ripper | Sewing tool only — not a craft kit |
| 10 | bobbin | Machine sewing part — not relevant |
| 11 | sewing table | Furniture — not relevant |
| 12 | embroidery machine | Machine embroidery equipment — not hand sewing |
| 13 | machine embroidery | Machine technique — not hand sewing |
| 14 | digitizing | Machine embroidery software — not relevant |

### Wrong Age Groups
> Searchers looking for different age groups than this product serves (ages 8+).

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | toddler | Product is ages 8+ — far too advanced for toddlers |
| 2 | baby | Product has needles and pins — not safe for babies |
| 3 | infant | Same — not safe for infants |
| 4 | 18 month | Far too young for sewing with needles |
| 5 | preschool | Product is ages 8+ — too complex for preschoolers |
| 6 | pre-k | Same — too young for this product |

**NOT negating:**
- "adult" — Gift buyers ARE adults; negating would block parent/grandparent searches

**Note:** Unlike the Fairy kit (ages 5-12), the Dessert kit targets ages 8+ so "toddler", "preschool", and "pre-k" are safely negated here without affecting any tracked keywords for THIS product's campaigns.

### Wrong Intent
> Searchers looking for non-product results.

## Negative EXACT Candidates

### Specific Irrelevant Products

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | sewing apron | Sewing accessory, not a craft kit |
| 2 | sewing tote bag | Sewing storage accessory |
| 3 | sewing organizer | Storage/organization product |
| 4 | sewing basket | Storage product |
| 5 | sewing box adult | Adult sewing supply storage |
| 6 | sewing kit travel | Travel repair kit — not a kids craft kit |
| 7 | sewing kit adult | Adult sewing/repair kit — wrong audience entirely |
| 8 | sewing machine for kids | Machine sewing — product is hand-sewing |
| 9 | baking kit for kids | Baking/cooking product — "dessert" theme is sewing, not food |
| 10 | cooking kit for kids | Cooking product — product makes felt desserts, not real food |
| 11 | play food | Toy food — product is a craft kit, not play food (though it makes dessert shapes) |
| 12 | fake food toys | Toy food — same concern as above |

### Cross-Portfolio Terms [REVIEW]

| # | Term | Belongs To | Why Consider |
|---|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | fuse beads kit | Fuse Beads portfolio | Wrong craft entirely — prevents cannibalization with own fuse bead products |
| 2 | latch hook kit | Latch Hook portfolio | Different craft — prevents cannibalization |
| 3 | embroidery kit for adults | 4 Flowers Embroidery portfolio | Wrong audience — this is a kids product |
| 4 | cross stitch sampler | Cross Stitch portfolio | Different product format |
| 5 | knitting kit for kids | Cat and Hat Knitting portfolio | Different craft — prevents cannibalization |
| 6 | lacing cards | Lacing Cards | Different product type — prevents cannibalization |

**Note:** Category 1 phrase negatives (fuse beads, latch hook, loom knitting, punch needle) already block most of these. Listed here for completeness.

### Color/Attribute Modifiers
> Sewing kits — customers search by theme (dessert), not felt color. Negate most colors.

**Preserved colors (dessert theme):**
- **pink** — Common dessert color (cupcakes, frosting, strawberry), preserved
- **brown** — Common dessert color (chocolate, brownies), preserved

**Flagged for review:**
- **gold** — Could indicate premium/metallic interest OR just a color [REVIEW]
- **silver** — Could indicate metallic/sprinkle interest OR just a color [REVIEW]

## Flagged for Review [BORDERLINE]

| # | Term | Match Type | Concern |
|---|------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | play food | Exact | Product makes felt dessert shapes — could overlap with "play food" searches if parents want a craft alternative to plastic play food. But most "play food" searches are for ready-made toys, not craft kits. |
| 2 | fake food toys | Exact | Same concern as play food — could attract parents looking for creative food-themed activity. But intent is usually pre-made toys. |
| 3 | gold | Phrase (color) | Could indicate premium/gift packaging interest. Or irrelevant color search. |
| 4 | silver | Phrase (color) | Could indicate metallic/decorative interest. Or irrelevant color search. |
| 5 | barbie | Phrase | Not a Barbie product. But Craftiloo IS launching Barbie sewing kits — negating could block future cross-sell. Consider only if dessert campaigns show high spend on "barbie" with zero orders. |
| 6 | keychain kit | Phrase | Product MAKES keychains, but "keychain kit" alone could attract people looking for non-sewing keychain crafts (e.g., resin, beading). However, this term is valuable — DO NOT negate. Listed here for awareness only. |

**Estimated impact:** The 26 wrong-craft-type phrase negatives will block hundreds of irrelevant search term variants (e.g., "crochet kit for kids", "diamond painting for kids", "fuse beads kit"). The 14 wrong-product-type phrases prevent "sewing machine" and equipment searches from triggering. The 6 wrong-age-group phrases block toddler/baby/preschool searches (stronger age filtering than the Fairy kit due to higher minimum age of 8+). The 66 color modifiers prevent color-specific searches that indicate single-item shopping rather than themed kit purchases. The 4 dessert-specific exact negatives (baking kit, cooking kit, play food, fake food) prevent food-intent searches from reaching this craft product. 23 competitor brands flagged for your review.
