## Negative PHRASE Candidates

### Wrong Craft Types
> These are entirely different craft categories. Searchers for these will never buy this product.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | crochet hook | Product is loom knitting, not crochet. NOTE: Only negating "crochet hook" — loom kits sometimes include crochet hooks as accessories |
| 2 | quilting | Product is loom knitting kit, not quilting |
| 3 | weaving | Product is loom knitting kit, not weaving |
| 4 | macrame | Product is loom knitting kit, not macrame |
| 5 | diamond painting | Product is loom knitting kit, not diamond painting |
| 6 | diamond art | Product is loom knitting kit, not diamond art |
| 7 | paint by number | Product is loom knitting kit, not paint by number |
| 8 | pottery | Product is loom knitting kit, not pottery |
| 9 | clay | Product is loom knitting kit, not clay craft |
| 10 | slime | Product is loom knitting kit, not slime |
| 11 | tie dye | Product is loom knitting kit, not tie dye |
| 12 | scrapbook | Product is loom knitting kit, not scrapbooking |
| 13 | origami | Product is loom knitting kit, not origami |
| 14 | jewelry making | Product is loom knitting kit, not jewelry making |
| 15 | fuse beads | Product is loom knitting kit, not fuse beads |
| 16 | perler beads | Product is loom knitting kit, not perler/fuse beads |
| 17 | melty beads | Product is loom knitting kit, not melty/fuse beads |
| 18 | iron beads | Product is loom knitting kit, not iron/fuse beads |
| 19 | felt craft | Product is loom knitting kit, not felt crafting |
| 20 | string art | Product is loom knitting kit, not string art |
| 21 | candle making | Product is loom knitting kit, not candle making |
| 22 | soap making | Product is loom knitting kit, not soap making |
| 23 | resin art | Product is loom knitting kit, not resin art |
| 24 | latch hook | Different sewing family craft — latch hook uses pre-cut yarn on canvas, not loom knitting |
| 25 | punch needle | Different sewing family craft — punch needle uses a punch tool, not loom pegs |

**NOT negating:**
- "crochet" broadly — Only negating "crochet hook". Loom knitting kits sometimes include a crochet hook as an accessory, and broad "crochet" negate could block relevant searches where customers compare crochet vs knitting.
- "embroidery" — Needle craft overlap exists. Customers browsing needle crafts for kids may discover this product.
- "cross stitch" — Needle craft overlap exists. Same logic as embroidery.
- "sewing" — Customers use "sewing" loosely for all needle/yarn crafts. "Sewing kit for kids" is a protected search term.
- "knitting" — That IS the product. NEVER negate.
- "needlepoint" — Some audience overlap with needle crafts.

### Wrong Product Types
> These share category words but are completely different products.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | knitting needles only | Supply-only purchase — product is a complete loom knitting kit, not loose needles |
| 2 | yarn only | Supply-only purchase — product is a complete kit |
| 3 | knitting machine | Industrial/electronic knitting machine — not a hand craft loom kit |
| 4 | circular needles | Needle knitting accessory — product uses looms, not needles |
| 5 | knitting gauge | Knitting measurement tool — not a craft kit |
| 6 | sewing machine | Product is a hand craft loom kit, not a machine |
| 7 | serger | Industrial sewing machine — not a hand craft kit |
| 8 | embroidery machine | Machine embroidery equipment — not a hand craft kit |

### Wrong Age Groups
> Searchers looking for different age groups than this product serves.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | toddler | Product is for ages 8+ — contains small parts and looms inappropriate for toddlers |
| 2 | baby | Product is for ages 8+ — contains small parts, not for babies |
| 3 | infant | Product is for ages 8+ — contains small parts, not for infants |
| 4 | 18 month | Product is for ages 8+ — far too young |
| 5 | preschool | Product is for ages 8+ — preschool is typically 3-5, too young for loom knitting |
| 6 | pre-k | Product is for ages 8+ — pre-k is ages 3-4, too young |

**NOT negating:**
- "adult" — Parents/grandparents may search adult-oriented terms when buying gifts. Adults also use loom knitting kits.

### Cross-Portfolio Terms [REVIEW]
| # | Term | Belongs To | Why Consider |
|---|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | fuse beads kit | Fuse Beads portfolio | Wrong craft entirely — prevents cannibalization |
| 2 | lacing cards for kids | Lacing Cards portfolio | Wrong product type — lacing cards are threading, not knitting |
| 3 | sewing machine | Sewing portfolio | Wrong product type — machine vs hand craft |
| 4 | embroidery kit for adults | Embroidery portfolio | Wrong age targeting and craft type |

**Note:** Most of these should already be blocked by the phrase negatives in Category 1 (fuse beads, latch hook, etc.). Listed here for completeness.

### Color/Attribute Modifiers
> Color terms indicating searcher wants a specific single-color item. Loom knitting kit = negate most colors.

### Competitor Brand Terms (Human Decision Required)

| # | Brand | Recommendation |
|---|-------|----------------|
| 1 | BeKnitting | [REVIEW] Direct knitting competitor. Keep unless search term data shows high spend + 0 orders |
| 2 | AUTHENTIC KNITTING BOARD | [REVIEW] Direct loom knitting competitor. May drive relevant traffic — brand searchers looking for loom kits |
| 3 | Boye | [REVIEW] Knitting/crochet tools brand. Searchers may want Boye-brand needles, not a loom kit |
| 4 | Kraftlab | [REVIEW] General craft kits — similar audience |
| 5 | Krafun | [REVIEW] General craft kits — similar audience |
| 6 | KLUTZ | [REVIEW] Well-known craft kit brand — may drive high-intent traffic for kids craft kits |
| 7 | Melissa and Doug | [REVIEW] Large kids brand — high brand loyalty, may waste spend |
| 8 | Creativity for Kids | [REVIEW] Direct competitor — kids craft kits. Brand searchers may convert |
| 9 | The Woobles | Consider negating as EXACT — crochet brand, different craft from loom knitting |
| 10 | Crochetta | Consider negating as EXACT — crochet brand, different craft from loom knitting |
| 11 | Mira HandCrafts | [REVIEW] Yarn/crafts brand — some overlap with knitting audience |

## Flagged for Review [BORDERLINE]

| # | Term | Match Type | Concern |
|---|------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | barbie | Phrase | This is NOT a Barbie product. However, Craftiloo has Barbie-branded products in the catalogue. Negating prevents wasted spend on brand-specific searches, but could block if Barbie products share campaigns. **Recommend negating at campaign level only if this product has its own campaigns.** |
| 2 | pink | Phrase | Not a kit color (kit has red, grey, white). But "pink knitting kit for kids" is a plausible search where this product could still convert. Borderline — negate if data shows waste. |
| 3 | needle knitting | Exact | Product is LOOM knitting, not needle knitting. However, many beginners don't distinguish methods. Negating may block naive searchers who would buy either type. |
| 4 | crochet | Phrase | Only "crochet hook" is negated. Broad "crochet" could send some irrelevant traffic, but loom kits sometimes include a crochet hook accessory. Customers searching "crochet kit for kids" are unlikely to buy this, but the risk of blocking "crochet hook for loom" searches exists. |
| 5 | adult | Phrase | Product is for kids 8+. But adults use loom knitting too, and parents/grandparents search adult-oriented terms when buying gifts. Safer to NOT negate. |
| 6 | finger knitting | Exact | Different technique from loom knitting. But audience overlap exists — parents looking for easy knitting methods for kids. Could convert. |
