**NOT negating:**
- "cross stitch" — Needlepoint and cross stitch share significant audience overlap. Customers often search "cross stitch kits for kids" when looking for needlepoint. Protected search terms include "cross stitch kits for kids", "kids cross stitch kit", etc.
- "embroidery" — Related needle art. Significant audience overlap. "Embroidery kit for kids" is a protected search term.
- "sewing" — Customers use "sewing" loosely for all needle crafts. "Sewing kit for kids" is a protected search term.
- "latch hook" — Some audience overlap with needlepoint. Both are canvas-based needle crafts.
- "knitting" — Some needle craft audience overlap. Not auto-negating.
- "punch needle" — Needle craft family overlap.

### Wrong Product Types
> These share category words but are completely different products.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | needlepoint canvas only | Supply-only purchase — product is a complete kit |
| 2 | tapestry frame | Frame accessory — not a craft kit |
| 3 | needlepoint stand | Stand accessory — not a craft kit |
| 4 | sewing machine | Product is a hand-stitching kit, not a machine |
| 5 | serger | Industrial sewing machine — not a hand craft kit |
| 6 | embroidery machine | Machine embroidery equipment — not a hand craft kit |
| 7 | machine embroidery | Machine-based embroidery — not a hand craft kit |
| 8 | digitizing | Embroidery software term — not a physical craft kit |
| 9 | embroidery software | Digital design tool — not a physical craft kit |
| 10 | stabilizer | Machine embroidery supply — not a hand craft kit |
| 11 | embroidery thread cone | Industrial-size thread — not a craft kit |

### Wrong Age Groups
> Searchers looking for different age groups than this product serves.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | toddler | Product is for ages 8+ — contains needles, inappropriate for toddlers |
| 2 | baby | Product is for ages 8+ — contains small parts and needles, not for babies |
| 3 | infant | Product is for ages 8+ — contains small parts and needles, not for infants |
| 4 | 18 month | Product is for ages 8+ — far too young |
| 5 | preschool | Product is for ages 8+ — preschool is typically 3-5, too young for needlepoint |
| 6 | pre-k | Product is for ages 8+ — pre-k is ages 3-4, too young |

**NOT negating:**
- "adult" — Parents/grandparents may search adult-oriented terms when buying gifts. Adults also enjoy needlepoint. Safer to keep.

### Cross-Portfolio Terms [REVIEW]
| # | Term | Belongs To | Why Consider |
|---|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | fuse beads kit | Fuse Beads portfolio | Wrong craft entirely — prevents cannibalization |
| 2 | lacing cards for kids | Lacing Cards portfolio | Wrong product type — lacing cards are threading, not needlepoint |
| 3 | sewing machine | Sewing portfolio | Wrong product type — machine vs hand craft |
| 4 | embroidery kit for adults | Embroidery (adult) portfolio | Wrong age targeting — this is for kids |

**Note:** Most of these should already be blocked by the phrase negatives in Category 1 (fuse beads, etc.) or Category 2 (sewing machine). Listed here for completeness.

**PRESERVED (not negated):**
- **black** — Cat theme is a black cat. Preserving "black" to catch "black cat needlepoint" and similar searches.

**FLAGGED for review:**
- **gold** — [REVIEW] Could indicate material preference (gold thread, metallic gold accents). Cat-themed products sometimes have gold accents. See Flagged section.
- **silver** — [REVIEW] Could indicate material preference (silver thread). See Flagged section.

### Competitor Brand Terms (Human Decision Required)

| # | Brand | Recommendation |
|---|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Kraftlab | [REVIEW] Direct competitor — craft kits for kids. Keep unless search term data shows high spend + 0 orders |
| 2 | Krafun | [REVIEW] Direct competitor — craft kits for kids. Same logic |
| 3 | KLUTZ | [REVIEW] Well-known craft kit brand — may drive high-intent traffic for kids craft kits |
| 4 | Melissa and Doug | [REVIEW] Large kids brand — high brand loyalty, may waste spend |
| 5 | Creativity for Kids | [REVIEW] Direct competitor — kids craft kits. Brand searchers may convert |
| 6 | Hapinest | [REVIEW] Kids crafts — similar audience |
| 7 | IQKidz | [REVIEW] Kids crafts — similar audience |
| 8 | Made By Me | [REVIEW] Kids crafts — similar audience. Known for needlepoint/sewing kits |
| 9 | Olikraft | [REVIEW] Craft kits — similar audience |
| 10 | FUNiOi | [REVIEW] Kids crafts — similar audience |
| 11 | The Woobles | Consider negating as EXACT — crochet brand, different craft entirely from needlepoint |
| 12 | Crochetta | Consider negating as EXACT — crochet brand, different craft entirely |
| 13 | BeKnitting | Consider negating as EXACT — knitting brand, different craft from needlepoint |
| 14 | AUTHENTIC KNITTING BOARD | Consider negating as EXACT — loom knitting brand, different craft from needlepoint |

## Flagged for Review [BORDERLINE]

| # | Term | Match Type | Concern |
|---|------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | barbie | Phrase | This is NOT a Barbie product. However, Craftiloo has Barbie-branded products in the catalogue including Barbie needlepoint items. Negating prevents wasted spend on brand-specific searches, but could block if Barbie products share campaigns. **Recommend negating at campaign level only if this product has its own campaigns.** |
| 2 | gold | Phrase | Cat-themed products sometimes feature gold accents. Could indicate "gold thread needlepoint" which is a legitimate craft term. But more likely indicates a gold-colored product preference. Low risk to negate, but flag for review. |
| 3 | silver | Phrase | Similar to gold — could mean silver thread, but more likely color preference. Low risk to negate. |
| 4 | purse | Exact | Product is a wallet, not a purse. However, "purse" and "wallet" overlap in customer language, especially for kids. Searchers for "needlepoint purse for kids" might buy this wallet. Safer to NOT negate. |
| 5 | adult | Phrase | Product is for kids 8+. But parents search adult-oriented terms when buying gifts. Safer to NOT negate. |
| 6 | coin purse | Exact | Product is a wallet, not specifically a coin purse. But significant overlap in the kids accessories space. Customers searching "needlepoint coin purse" might buy this wallet. Safer to NOT negate. |
| 7 | cross stitch wallet | Exact | Product is technically needlepoint, not cross stitch. But significant technique overlap — customers often use these terms interchangeably. Do NOT negate — protected term overlap with "cross stitch kits for kids". |
