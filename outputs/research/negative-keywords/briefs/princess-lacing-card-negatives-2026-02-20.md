**NOT negating:**

- "toddler" — lacing cards target ages 3+ and "toddler sewing kits ages 2-4" is a tracked keyword
- "lacing" — that IS the product

### Wrong Product Types
> These share category words but are completely different products.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|

- "baby" — [REVIEW below] — see Flagged for Review
- "preschool" — ages 3-5 IS the target preschool age range
- "pre-k" — same as preschool, target age group
- "infant" — [REVIEW below] — 18 months may be too young but 2-3 year olds use lacing cards

### Competitor Brand Terms (Human Decision Required)

#### Direct Lacing Card Competitors

| # | Brand | Category Focus | Recommendation |
|---|-------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | Melissa and Doug | Direct competitor in lacing cards | [REVIEW] High brand awareness — could convert if product is competitive. Negate only if data shows high spend + 0 orders. |
| 2 | KLUTZ | Kids crafts / activity kits | [REVIEW] General craft brand — may or may not overlap with lacing cards |
| 3 | Creativity for Kids | Kids crafts | [REVIEW] Broad kids craft brand — some overlap possible |
| 4 | Hapinest | Kids crafts / activities | [REVIEW] Kids activity brand — moderate overlap potential |

#### Broader Craftiloo Competitors (Less Relevant to Lacing Cards)

| # | Brand | Relevant to Lacing Cards? | Recommendation |
|---|-------|--------------------------|----------------|
| 5 | The Woobles | No — crochet only | Consider negating as EXACT if showing in lacing card campaigns |
| 6 | Crochetta | No — crochet only | Consider negating as EXACT |
| 7 | BeKnitting | No — knitting only | Consider negating as EXACT |
| 8 | AUTHENTIC KNITTING BOARD | No — knitting only | Consider negating as EXACT |
| 9 | Boye | No — knitting/crochet tools | Consider negating as EXACT |
| 10 | Mira HandCrafts | No — yarn/crafts | Consider negating as EXACT |
| 11 | Kraftlab | Maybe — general craft kits | [REVIEW] Keep unless data shows waste |
| 12 | Krafun | Maybe — general craft kits | [REVIEW] Keep unless data shows waste |

## Flagged for Review [BORDERLINE]

| # | Term | Match Type | Concern |
|---|------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | infant | Phrase | 18 months is too young for lacing cards, but 2-3 year olds can use them. "Infant" typically means 0-12 months, so likely safe to negate — but verify if any tracked terms include "infant." |
| 2 | gold | Phrase (color) | Princess theme could include gold crowns, tiaras, accents. May block relevant traffic like "gold princess craft." |
| 3 | silver | Phrase (color) | Princess theme could include silver accessories. Same concern as gold. |
| 4 | barbie | Phrase | This is NOT a Barbie product, but Barbie princess overlap is possible. "Barbie lacing cards" searchers may accept a generic princess product. |

## Safety Check Results

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Cross-referenced against protected search terms | ✅ All tracked lacing card terms verified safe — "lacing cards", "sewing cards", "toddler sewing", "threading board for kids" etc. all preserved |
| "Sewing" preserved | ✅ NOT negated — "sewing cards for kids" and "toddler sewing" are tracked keywords |
| "Toddler" preserved | ✅ NOT negated — "toddler sewing kits ages 2-4", "lacing cards for toddlers" are tracked keywords |
| Product title terms excluded | ✅ "princess", "lacing", "card", "kit" all preserved |
| Own category terms preserved | ✅ "lacing cards" terms preserved |
| Pink/purple colors preserved | ✅ Princess theme colors NOT negated |
| Competitor brands flagged | ✅ Listed separately for human decision — not auto-negated |

## Summary

| Category | Negative Phrase | Negative Exact | Flagged |

| Wrong craft types | 30 | — | 0 |
| Wrong product types | 10 | — | 0 |
| Wrong age groups | 4 | — | 1 |

| **TOTAL** | **134** | **12** | **16** |

**Estimated impact:** The 30 wrong-craft-type phrase negatives will block hundreds of irrelevant search term variants from triggering on broad/auto campaigns. The 67 color modifiers will prevent single-color searches from wasting spend on a multi-design princess kit (while preserving pink and purple for princess theme relevance). The 10 wrong-product-type phrases will prevent "cards" overlap with flash cards, playing cards, and greeting cards. 12 competitor brands flagged for your review — Melissa & Doug is the most critical decision as they are a direct lacing card competitor.

When ready, say **"approved"** or **"generate"** and I'll produce the copy-paste output.
