## Negative PHRASE Candidates

| 24 | candle making | Wax craft — no overlap |
| 25 | soap making | Chemical craft — no overlap |

**NOT negating:**
- "iron" — "iron beads" is a tracked keyword for fuse beads
- "perler" — category name, NEVER negate
- "hama" — category name, NEVER negate
- "melty" — category synonym for fuse beads
- Colors — fuse beads are multi-color, customers search by color
- "bulk" — "fuse beads bulk" is a tracked keyword

### Wrong Product Types
> These share "bead" or related terms but are completely different products.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | bead loom | Weaving loom for seed beads — different craft entirely |
| 2 | seed beads | Tiny glass beads for jewelry — not fuse beads |
| 3 | jewelry beads | Beads for stringing/jewelry — not ironing |
| 4 | pony beads | Large plastic beads for stringing — not ironing |
| 5 | letter beads | Alphabet beads for bracelets — not ironing |
| 6 | water beads | Orbeez-type sensory beads — completely different |
| 7 | orbeez | Water bead brand — not fuse beads |
| 8 | pop beads | Snap-together beads for kids — not ironing |
| 9 | bead spinner | Jewelry making tool — not fuse beads |
| 10 | charm beads | Jewelry charms — not fuse beads |
| 11 | glass beads | Jewelry/decor beads — not fuse beads |
| 12 | wooden beads | Threading/jewelry beads — not fuse beads |
| 13 | bead bracelet | Jewelry product — not fuse bead art |
| 14 | bead necklace | Jewelry product — not fuse bead art |

### Wrong Age Groups
> Searchers looking for different age groups than this product serves (ages 4-7).

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | baby | 10mm beads are still a choking hazard for babies |
| 2 | infant | Same — unsafe for infants |
| 3 | 18 month | Far too young for any fuse beads |

**NOT negating:**
- "toddler" — [REVIEW] Age 4 is borderline toddler. Some parents of 4-year-olds still search "toddler crafts." Flagged for review.
- "adult" — Adults may buy biggie beads as gifts or for occupational therapy. Keep.
- "preschool" — Age 4-5 IS preschool. This is the target age group.
- "pre-k" — Same as preschool, target age group.

### Wrong Intent
> Searchers looking for non-product results.

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | free pattern | Looking for free digital content, not a physical kit |
| 2 | free download | Looking for free digital files |
| 3 | printable pattern | Looking for digital template, not physical product |
| 4 | digital pattern | Digital-only content |
| 5 | pdf pattern | Digital file |
| 6 | ebook | Digital book, not physical product |
| 7 | e-book | Digital book, not physical product |
| 8 | online class | Education, not product |
| 9 | virtual class | Education, not product |
| 10 | wholesale | Commercial buyer — different channel |
| 11 | resale | Looking to resell, not end user |
| 12 | secondhand | Looking for used product |
| 13 | second hand | Looking for used product |
| 14 | rental | Looking for rental, not purchase |
| 15 | replacement parts only | Looking for spare parts, not full kit |

**NOT negating:**
- "bulk" — "fuse beads bulk" is a tracked keyword
- "refill" — big sets could serve as refills; 1,500 beads is a substantial amount
- "pattern" alone — kits include 48 patterns

## Negative EXACT Candidates

### Specific Irrelevant Products

| # | Term | Why Negate |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | perler bead display | Looking for display/storage, not a crafting kit |
| 2 | bead organizer | Storage product, not a craft kit |
| 3 | bead storage container | Storage product |
| 4 | pegboard wall | Wall-mounted storage pegboard — not craft pegboard |
| 5 | peg board organizer | Wall organizer, not craft tool |
| 6 | bead curtain | Home decor product |
| 7 | mini perler beads | Wrong size — this product is 10mm BIG beads, not mini 2.6mm |
| 8 | 2.6mm fuse beads | Wrong size — explicit search for mini beads, not biggie beads |

### Cross-Portfolio Terms [REVIEW]

| # | Term | Belongs To | Why Consider |
|---|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | sewing kit for kids | Sewing portfolio | Wrong craft entirely — would only trigger in broad/auto |
| 2 | embroidery kit | Embroidery portfolio | Wrong craft entirely |
| 3 | cross stitch kit | Cross Stitch portfolio | Wrong craft entirely |
| 4 | latch hook kit | Latch Hook portfolio | Wrong craft entirely |
| 5 | knitting kit | Knitting portfolio | Wrong craft entirely |
| 6 | lacing cards | Lacing Cards portfolio | Wrong craft entirely |

**Note:** Most of these should already be blocked by the Category 1 phrase negatives (sewing, embroidery, cross stitch, latch hook, knitting). Listed here for completeness. "Lacing cards" is the one exception — not covered by a phrase negative above.

### Color/Attribute Modifiers

> **SKIPPED for Fuse Beads.** Fuse bead kits ARE multi-color products — customers search by color to find specific bead colors/refills (e.g., "blue fuse beads", "red perler beads"). Negating colors would block legitimate traffic.
>
> The 70-color TitanOS "Never KWs" list is **NOT applied** to this portfolio.
>
> **Special note:** "iron" appears in the color list but "iron beads" is a tracked keyword for fuse beads — correctly excluded from negation.

### Competitor Brand Terms (Human Decision Required)

#### Fuse Bead Category Brands (KEEP — category names)

| # | Brand | Recommendation |
|---|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Perler | Category name at this point. **Keep — NEVER negate.** |
| 2 | Hama | Category name at this point. **Keep — NEVER negate.** |

#### Other Craft Brands (Less Relevant to Fuse Beads)

| # | Brand | Relevant to Biggie Beads? | Recommendation |
|---|-------|---------------------------|----------------|
| 3 | The Woobles | No — crochet only | Consider negating as EXACT if showing in fuse bead campaigns |
| 4 | Crochetta | No — crochet only | Consider negating as EXACT |
| 5 | BeKnitting | No — knitting only | Consider negating as EXACT |
| 6 | AUTHENTIC KNITTING BOARD | No — knitting only | Consider negating as EXACT |
| 7 | Boye | No — knitting/crochet tools | Consider negating as EXACT |
| 8 | Mira HandCrafts | No — yarn/crafts | Consider negating as EXACT |
| 9 | Melissa and Doug | Maybe — kids crafts broadly | [REVIEW] Keep unless data shows waste |
| 10 | Kraftlab | Maybe — general craft kits | [REVIEW] Keep unless data shows waste |
| 11 | Krafun | Maybe — general craft kits | [REVIEW] Keep unless data shows waste |
| 12 | Creativity for Kids | Maybe — kids crafts | [REVIEW] Keep unless data shows waste |
| 13 | NBEADS | Yes — beading supplies | [REVIEW] Could overlap with fuse bead searches |

## Flagged for Review [BORDERLINE]

| # | Term | Match Type | Concern |
|---|------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | toddler | Phrase | Age 4 is borderline toddler. Parents of 4-year-olds often search "toddler crafts." Negating could block buyers of exactly this age group. However, most toddler searches (ages 1-3) are too young for fuse beads. |
| 2 | mini perler beads | Exact | Wrong size for this product (10mm vs 2.6mm), but searcher might accept larger beads. Also, shinshin sells both sizes — cross-portfolio overlap. |
| 3 | 2.6mm fuse beads | Exact | Explicit wrong size search. But shinshin sells 2.6mm under same brand — negating on CX15 campaigns only makes sense. |
| 4 | 5mm fuse beads | Exact | Standard size, not biggie 10mm. But some parents may not care about exact bead size. Could be relevant. |
| 5 | barbie | Phrase | Not a Barbie product. But fuse bead Barbie patterns exist — customers could make Barbie designs with any bead kit. |
| 6 | lacing cards | Exact | Cross-portfolio term. Not covered by any phrase negative above. Recommend negating as EXACT to prevent fuse bead campaigns from showing on lacing card searches. |

## Summary

| Category | Negative Phrase | Negative Exact | Flagged |

**Estimated impact:** The 26 wrong-craft-type phrase negatives will block hundreds of irrelevant search term variants from triggering on broad/auto campaigns. The 14 wrong-product-type phrases will prevent "bead" overlap with jewelry/water bead/stringing bead searches — critical for fuse beads where "bead" is a high-volume but ambiguous term. Color modifiers correctly skipped (multi-color product). 13 competitor brands flagged for your review. Key difference from the mini/standard fuse beads brief: "toddler" is flagged for review rather than negated (age 4 is borderline), and wrong-size terms (mini, 2.6mm) are flagged rather than auto-negated due to cross-portfolio overlap within shinshin creation.
