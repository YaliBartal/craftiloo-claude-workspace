    "title": "Awesome rainbow pom pom hat & cup cozy knitting kit perfect for kids & knitting newbies like me!",
    "text": "UPDATE: I realized after I had posted my review & pictures before that the rainbow hat I had made was actually inside out...Yikes!!! So after having reversed the hat & carefully removing the pom poms & then replacing them back onto the hat again, I am soooooo much happier with how it looks now & although I thought it looked great before, I see that the weave looks so much better now & that the rim of the hat now \"curls\" outwards & upwards like it should!! Being that I am totally new to this loom knitting thing & despite my initial mistake with accidentally placing the pom poms on what was actually supposed to be the inside on the hat ....I am very glad that my mistake was one that was very easily fixable & I am super happy with how the hat turned out in the end....I even posted 2 new updated pics to show the difference in how it looks from my original ones!! (My original review is below:) So Lately I have taken a keen interest in learning to knit & crochet....and I have recently been buying several different kinds of beginners & kids level knitting & crocheting sets to learn. This rainbow pom pom hat & cup cozy knitting loom kit is really cute & seemed like a great way to start my first ever round loom knitting projects especially as I had never used an actual round knitting loom before. This kit being aimed for kids to use seemed like a perfectly unintimidating place for me to start. I found that the directions were very easy to follow & the loom, the tools & the yarn are all of excellent quality. I really enjoyed the whole process & was very excited as my initial project started taking shape....and I was cheered on & encouraged by my hubby & our 2 girls (who at this time are not at all interested in learning knitting but are very creative in drawing & painting type art) so they all were so happy when I very successfully completed both the rainbow pom pom hat & cup cozy projects with no problems at all. This was lots of fun for me to use & I am really pleased with how they both came out & they even look very much like the pictures on the box!! They give you plenty of yarn to do both of these projects & I still have enough left over to use to make another small size item. The hat size is exactly as it should be & even though my hubby's noggin is a larger size than what this hat is made for, he was still able to fit it on to wear for a photo opportunity....Lol. The cup cozy worked out perfect too....although the instructions are easy to follow, I did go to the manufacturer's web tutorial they have for these projects to watch me making the cup cozy just to double-check that I was looming it correctly....which I was!! The loom & the tools in this kit are all very well made & sturdy & I will be using them all to make several more various knitted items in the future as well, so this kit is an excellent value which has so much more use after you finish the hat & cup cozy....now I can't wait to buy some more yarn and create some more!! :) Separate Review below is for the Hat Not Hate Knitting Kit: For some reason I can't do a separate review on it's own for the Hat Not Hate Knit Hats Kit, but I also wanted to include a review plus pictures for that one as well. I would give this kit 4 stars rather than 5 if I could because unlike the Rainbow Pom Pom Hat & Cup Cozy kit, this Hat Not Hate kit had several loose wobbly pegs on the loom that I had to contend with & unfortunately I hadn't realized how problematic that was until after I had already started several rows of my first HNH hat. At one point I did have a peg pop out of the loom, but luckily since the yarn was wound throughout the loom, it kept it from completely falling out & so I had managed to push it back in place as best I could. I managed to finish that hat by having to securely counter-press on each of the loose pegs as I came to them as I was working since otherwise I was worried I would have a catastrophe & lose all of my work!! The Rainbow Hat & Cup Cozy's loom is of a much better quality & is so much more sturdy & solid to work with.....not one loose peg on it even after using it to finish my second Hat Not Hat hat (since fortunately it is the same exact size) & another different hat as well. So other than trying to superglue those loose pegs of the Hat Not Hate loom into place, I don't really see how I could get any further work done using the Hat Not Hate loom which is very unfortunate. The other issue I had with the HNH kit was that one skein out of the four I had received in the kit was an absolute nightmare to work with. There must have been some sort of manufacturing problem with it because even though it was wrapped & banded (so it was definitely not pre-used) the yarn was so tangled, mangled & knotted on the inside of the skein that I had spent over an hour & a half trying to get it sorted out.....on the outside of the skein it looked completely fine & new, but the inside yarn was the big problem & unfortunately I had only realized this after I had already started several rows into my first Hat Not Hate hat!! The other 3 skeins of yarn in the Hat Not Hate kit are fine though & so the second HNH hat that I had made using the other kit's loom I had made with no problems whatsoever. So my first HNH hat made using the defective yarn & loose-pegged loom was not really a great or fun experience for me although I do feel that the hat did turn out pretty good considering all the obstacles I had to deal with....in comparison, the second HNH hat I made using a different loom & another skein of HNH kit yarn that was included & not defective was a breeze to make & turned out excellent! I really appreciate & support the anti-bullying stance that Hat Not Hate stands for.....and despite the issues I had with those 2 items in this kit, the hats both turned out great in the end & they will both be very proudly worn!!!!",

Every once in a while so we will see if finished by next year. She at least learned how to knit. Great product. Very happy with instructions and material.",

    "text": "My kids absolutely loved the Creativity for Kids Quick Knit Button Scarf kit! This is such a fun, easy, and rewarding craft project for children, especially those new to knitting. The instructions are super clear and beginner-friendly, making it perfect for kids ages 8 and up. My daughter (who's 10) was able to start knitting almost immediately with minimal help! The rainbow yarn is vibrant and beautiful, and the scarf turns out so cute once it's all done. It's great that it comes with buttons, so it's not just a typical scarf – it becomes a stylish, buttoned-up accessory! The knitting process was simple and quick, and my child felt such a sense of accomplishment once the scarf was finished. This kit is an awesome way to introduce kids to a new creative hobby while developing their fine motor skills and patience. Plus, it's a fantastic screen-free activity! Whether they make it for themselves or as a gift, this is a great addition to any crafting collection. Highly recommend for any young knitter!",

    "text": "This is a terrific product. It comes with good instructions, fuzzy pretty yard, nice size plastic needles. However for someone learning to knit for the very first time I found the materials difficult to work with. The fuzzy yarn slips off the plastic needle and the fuzziness makes checking stitches hard. I bought this kit first but in the end I purchased smaller wooden needles and thin, not soft, cotton yarn to learn how to knit. Maybe when I have my stitches really down I can come back to this kit and make a cozy scarf.",

    "text": "I recently purchased this set for my daughter (who is 9 years old) and we worked together in the beginning to both learn how to weave using the included hand loom. Since purchasing this set, we've gone on to purchase additional hand looms of varying sizes, and with what we learned from this set we were able to make larger items (like a small baby blanket). My daughter has tried crochet in the past and enjoys this figure-8 weaving much more (and I feel the same way). The items you can make from this set are easy and intuitive to create, and they hold up well! Our favorite has been the handband with the bow - super cute! I highly recommend this set to beginners of all ages.",

All the materials were included and there were paper directions as well as links to online videos that went through each step to make the scarf. The yarn is why I'm giving this product three stars. The yarn did fray and split at the ends a little. There were also two knots in the yarn that was annoying to work around. But, for a beginner, the yarn is functional enough and the material is super soft and colorful! I'd recommend the scarf kit for beginners if you're not too picky about the yarn quality.",
