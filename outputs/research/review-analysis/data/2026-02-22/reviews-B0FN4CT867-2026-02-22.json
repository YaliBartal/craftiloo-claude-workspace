    "reviewDescription": "This fuse bead kit is awesome! I got this kit as a shared Christmas gift for my 7 and 10 year old. They both have used kits like this at afterschool programs and at friends’ houses, but were really pumped to have their own set. The colors are vibrant and there are so many in the kit the kids will be able to make a ton of things. I also like that there are multiple pegboards with so many templates to choose from to have a guide on making things, but of course the kids can use their imagination to craft whatever they want. The case is prefect, keeping the colors separated, and making it easy to store or travel with. This craft kit is worth it!",

    "reviewDescription": "Yes, this was absolutely for me. Sometimes I just want a break from diamond painting and these are perfect for switching things up. The set is really nice. Tons of beads in a great range of colors, and everything you need is included. The pegboards are sturdy, the tweezers work well, and having multiple ironing papers is handy. The beads melt evenly and hold their shape nicely once fused. It’s oddly relaxing and scratches that same creative itch without being the same activity every time. Easy to pick up, easy to put down, and very satisfying when a piece is finished. If you like crafty projects but want a change of pace now and then, this is a great set to have around.",
