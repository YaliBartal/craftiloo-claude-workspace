**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Product:** 48 Mini Fuse Beads Kit (B09THLVFZK)
**Category:** Mini Fuse Beads (2.6mm)
**Reviews Analyzed:** 50 ours + 109 across 3 competitors = 159 total
**Previous Snapshot:** None — first run

---

## Executive Summary

Our 48 Mini Fuse Beads kit is the clear quality leader in this competitive set with a 4.62 average rating and 90% satisfaction — dramatically outperforming INSCRAFT (4.02) and LIHAO (3.74) on the metrics that matter most. Both competitors are getting hammered on melting/fusing quality (9 complaints each), a problem we essentially don't have. Our biggest opportunity is launching single-color refill bags — customers across all brands are begging for them.

**Sentiment Health:** STRONG
**Top Finding:** Competitors' #1 complaint (inconsistent melting) is our #1 advantage — our beads melt evenly and produce durable results. This should be front-and-center in listing copy.
**Most Urgent Action:** Launch single-color refill packs (black, white, and popular colors) — 3+ mentions across brands, zero suppliers offer this in mini beads.

## Top Complaint Themes (Our Product)

| # | Theme | Frequency | % of Reviews | Avg Stars | Example Quote |
|---|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | Pegboard warping | 3 mentions | 6% | 4.3 | "Do NOT use the iron to melt the beads while it's still on the pegboard! Half of my boards have warped." |
| 2 | Size confusion (mini vs standard) | 3 mentions | 6% | 4.3 | "They were much smaller than regular ones" |
| 3 | Color balance (too many blues) | 3 mentions | 6% | 4.3 | "Too many shades of blue and not enough of others. I find myself particularly in more need of grays, white and black." |
| 4 | Missing/incomplete contents | 2 mentions | 4% | 1.5 | "I received a kit that clearly had been previously used. Beads were missing." |

**Important context:** Complaints #2 (size) and #3 (color balance) came from reviews that still gave 3-5 stars — these are "wish list" items, not deal-breakers. Complaint #4 appears to be a fulfillment issue (returned/resold product), not a manufacturing defect.

**Quality/Safety Flags:**

| Severity | Theme | Frequency | Details | Action |
|----------|-------|-----------|---------|--------|
| MEDIUM | Pegboard warping | 3 mentions | Boards warp when iron applied directly; still usable but frustrating | Add prominent "tape method" instructions; investigate heat-resistant boards |

**No CRITICAL or HIGH severity flags for our product.**
