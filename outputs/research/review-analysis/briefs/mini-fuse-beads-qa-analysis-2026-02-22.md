# Amazon Q&A Intelligence: Mini Fuse Beads Competitors

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**ASINs Analyzed:** B0C5WQD914, B08QV9CMFQ, B09THLVFZK
**Source:** Review-derived Q&A themes (150 reviews total) + web search intelligence

## IMPORTANT: Data Source Limitation

**Amazon Q&A pages could NOT be scraped directly.** Two blockers:

1. **Apify monthly usage hard limit exceeded** -- no actors can run until the billing cycle resets
2. **Amazon CAPTCHA/bot detection** -- all direct programmatic access (WebFetch, cheerio, puppeteer with residential proxies) returned CAPTCHAs or 404s on Q&A pages

**What this report contains instead:** Q&A-equivalent intelligence extracted from 150 customer reviews (50 per ASIN) and web search data. Customer reviews frequently contain the same questions and answers that appear in the Q&A section -- customers ask questions in their reviews, answer common concerns, and address the same themes.

**To get actual Q&A data:** Re-run this scrape once the Apify billing cycle resets, or manually access the Q&A pages in a browser.

## Q&A Themes by Category

### 1. SIZE / SCALE

**This is the #1 question/concern across ALL three products.**

| ASIN | Mentions | Key Customer Statements |
|------|----------|------------------------|
| B0C5WQD914 | 14/50 (28%) | "Does not make it clear these are MINIATURE fuse beads" / "NOT THE SAME SIZE AS PERLERS" / "I didn't even realize these beads came in different sizes" |
| B08QV9CMFQ | 18/50 (36%) | "Soooo tiny" / "I didn't read the word mini or the size of the beads" / "These are not normal sized fuse beads -- they are MINI" |
| B09THLVFZK | 10/50 (20%) | "They were much smaller than regular ones" / "I didn't know the difference" / "Beads half the size means double the detail!" |

**Implied Q&A:**
- **Q: Are these the same size as regular Perler beads?**
- **A: NO. These are 2.6mm mini beads, roughly half the size of standard 5mm Perler beads. They require tweezers and are better for teens/adults.**

**Competitive Insight:** shinshin creation (B09THLVFZK) has the LOWEST size-confusion rate at 20% vs INSCRAFT's 28% and LIHAO's 36%. This suggests our listing does a better job communicating the mini size.

### 2. AGE / SKILL LEVEL

| ASIN | Mentions | Key Customer Statements |
|------|----------|------------------------|
| B0C5WQD914 | 8/50 (16%) | "Would not buy for young children, package says 12+, I agree" / "Not for small children" / "Recommend for tweens up" / "size is just right for older kids" |
| B08QV9CMFQ | 8/50 (16%) | "Would be too small for most young kids" / "My 8 year old was so happy" / "Kids enjoy it very much" |
| B09THLVFZK | 8/50 (16%) | "My kid (8yrs) absolutely loves them... good for dexterity and motor skills" / "Not sure they would be the best choice for younger crafters" / "My kids are 14, 19, and 21" / "high school aged daughter" |

**Implied Q&A:**
- **Q: What age is this appropriate for?**
- **A: Ages 8+ with some adult help. Best for ages 12+ (teens and adults). Younger children (under 8) will struggle with the tiny beads. Requires fine motor skills and patience. Great for developing dexterity.**

- **Q: Can my 6-year-old use these?**
- **A: Not recommended. One INSCRAFT reviewer bought for a 6-year-old and they "were way too small for her to enjoy." Stick to standard 5mm beads for younger children.**

**Competitive Insight:** All three products show identical age mention rates (16%). shinshin creation reviews skew toward older users (teens, adults, grandchildren) which aligns better with the "for adults" positioning.

### 3. COMPATIBILITY

| ASIN | Mentions | Key Customer Statements |
|------|----------|------------------------|
| B0C5WQD914 | 5/50 (10%) | "These can't be used with any other kind of beads because they melt flat while the other beads keep their shape" / "I'm used to the perler brand (they are compatible with them)" / "Beads are different material from brand name Perler Beads" |
| B08QV9CMFQ | 5/50 (10%) | "I highly recommend not mixing these with other brands" / "Definitely not as good as Perler they melt different" / "lower heat point so they will melt much faster" |
| B09THLVFZK | 4/50 (8%) | "Works well with both Perler and Artkal brands" / "Great base colour set for Perler bead enthusiasts" / "compatible with leftover Perler beads" |

**Implied Q&A:**
- **Q: Are these compatible with Perler/Hama/Artkal mini beads?**
- **A: Size is compatible (2.6mm fits same pegboards). BUT do NOT mix brands in the same project -- they have different melting points and will fuse unevenly. shinshin creation reviews report the best cross-brand compatibility.**

- **Q: Can I use these with my existing mini pegboards?**
- **A: Yes, all 2.6mm beads work with standard mini pegboards from Perler, Hama, and Artkal.**

**Competitive Insight:** shinshin creation (B09THLVFZK) gets the most POSITIVE compatibility mentions. Competitors get more warnings about NOT mixing brands.

### 4. QUALITY / MELTING CONSISTENCY

**This is the #2 concern across all products, especially for INSCRAFT and LIHAO.**

| ASIN | Mentions | Key Customer Statements |
|------|----------|------------------------|
| B0C5WQD914 | 12/50 (24%) | "Inconsistent Bead Melting -- lighter colors melt different" / "Do not melt properly -- completely melt into a puddle even on lowest setting" / "Beads are all different diameter and different lengths" / "some colors melt great while others get really brittle" |
| B08QV9CMFQ | 14/50 (28%) | "They are gummy after melting and do not melt evenly" / "They melt way too easily and get stuck to the peg board" / "the ironing paper they give you is A PIECE OF PLASTIC THAT MELTS" / "Neither the beads nor the pegboard can withstand the heat" |
| B09THLVFZK | 5/50 (10%) | "Beads can tend to melt unevenly. Either too quick or too slow" / "Board warps slightly when ironing but still very usable" / "they melted better than the 5mm perler brand beads" |

**Implied Q&A:**
- **Q: Do these beads melt evenly?**
- **A: Mixed results across brands. LIHAO has the worst melting complaints (28%). INSCRAFT has inconsistency issues especially with lighter colors (24%). shinshin creation gets the fewest melting complaints (10%) and even gets praise for melting better than Perler.**

- **Q: What iron temperature should I use?**
- **A: Use LOW heat. These mini beads melt at a lower temperature than standard 5mm beads. Multiple reviewers across all brands report beads melting into puddles or becoming gummy on medium/high heat. Use the tape method instead of ironing directly on the pegboard to prevent board warping.**

**Competitive Insight:** This is a MAJOR competitive advantage for shinshin creation -- 10% melting complaints vs 24-28% for competitors.

### 5. CONTENTS / WHAT'S INCLUDED

| ASIN | Mentions | Key Customer Statements |
|------|----------|------------------------|
| B0C5WQD914 | 6/50 (12%) | "Ended up not having the tweezers it says it provides" / "Should come with more black beads" / "Kit does not include instructions -- heat settings, patterns, anything" |
| B08QV9CMFQ | 5/50 (10%) | "This time it came used -- no tweezers nor heat paper" / "Could have come with more iron paper" / "The provided paper with the designs do not line up with the pegboards" |
| B09THLVFZK | 4/50 (8%) | "It came with extra baggies of white and black beads" / "Didn't come with all the pictures that it showed in the advertisement -- Batman, Ninja, turtle, pokeball, Superman & Lightning McQueen missing" / "Came with two tweezers, as well as two bags of extra black and white beads" |

**Implied Q&A:**
- **Q: Does this kit come with everything I need?**
- **A: Yes, all three kits include pegboards, tweezers, ironing paper, and beads. You only need to add a household iron. shinshin creation ALSO includes extra black and white beads (noted by multiple reviewers as a standout positive).**

- **Q: Are there enough black beads?**
- **A: Across all brands, customers report running out of black beads first. INSCRAFT and LIHAO do NOT include extra black. shinshin creation includes extra bags of black and white -- this is praised specifically by multiple reviewers.**

- **Q: Does it come with patterns/instructions?**
- **A: All kits include some pattern sheets. INSCRAFT and LIHAO patterns reportedly don't align well with pegboards. Some INSCRAFT reviewers report no instructions at all.**

**Competitive Insight:** Extra black/white beads is a UNIQUE competitive advantage for shinshin creation that competitors lack.

**Implied Q&A:**
- **Q: Is this safe for children?**
- **A: Contains small parts -- choking hazard for children under 3. Not recommended for children under 6. Ironing requires adult supervision. The beads themselves are non-toxic.**

**Competitive Insight:** Low mention rate across all products. Not a significant differentiator.

**Implied Q&A:**
