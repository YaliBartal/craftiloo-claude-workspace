A ridiculously cute, squishy strawberry pillow that looks good enough to eat. It’s soft, colorful, and makes the perfect gift or cozy couch buddy. Bonus points for keeping me off my phone for a few hours—10/10 would craft again!",

      "text": "I do a lot of hooked rug kits. This one was great. The printed design on the canvas is very clear and printed in matching colors to the yarn that actually matches what is printed on the canvas. (This isn't always the case with some hook rug kits). The quality of the yarn is also very good. It is firm, but still pleasantly soft. The package includes everything you need--printed canvas, cut yarn bundles, hook ( with wooden handle, which is good quality) and easy to follow instructions. You do not need to refer back and forth to a color grid or count squares. This is great for a little kid or beginner. The canvas has a binding around it and is finished so you don't have to do any sewing. There are even hanging tabs so it will hang nicely. Please note-- The canvas is VERY small, so be sure to check the dimensions. It measures 11\" x 12\", which is a good size for a beginner so they don't become discouraged or lose interest. It took me approximately 6 hours to complete the project. It is meant to be used as a wall hanging. I had planned on turning it into a small pillow for my granddaughter, but it is really too small for that. I would definitely give this kit 5 stars and recommend it for a beginner. I am not sure if a 6 year old would have the manual dexterity for this. Probably more suited to 7 or 8 year old, or a 6 year old with a lot of patience and excellent manual dexterity. Very good product. A bit more expensive than some hook rug kits, based on the size, but well worth it for the quality.",

My only complaint is that I didn’t have enough of the red to finish it, so I used some green from a different project and put that at the top (and used those red strands to fill the gap). Edited to add that I’ve made this pillow twice now, and both times I have been short on red yarn. I have an excess of both white and pink but am very short on red. I luckily had a similar red from another project, but would obviously prefer that the kit in order has everything I need to complete the project.",

This particular brand of kit is great no matter the age. The imprint is clear, everything is provided, and the yarn doesn't fall apart like a different brand's does.

      "text": "As someone curious about latch hooking, this little kit was a perfect intro. It was small, bright and colorful, and not overwhelming to tackle. The instructions were decent although for me, a video was more helpful on learning how to manipulate the tool and fibers. Now while I am grateful to have found this kit, my one giant gripe is that the yarn fibers came in UNSORTED bundles. Which means that ALL the colors were mixed together in several various bundles. I don't understand why, at that point where there are multiple bundles anyway, they couldn't put them in there presorted, but alas. My partner was kind enough to sort them all into baggies for me so it was easier to work this piece. The yarn quality was....to be expected from a kit this cheap, but functional nonetheless. I would say it could be good for kids if the kid has the patience to learn how to work the tool. After that, it's easy going. The schematic is painted on the \"canvas\", so there is no pattern to have to refer to for placement like some other kits. That's really nice actually, then you can just cruise control through the project. So yea, fiber sorting aside, it was a good entry experience. Made me appreciate the nicer kits out there for sure.",

If a kid under 10 was doing this on their own I think it would be quite a long haul, they might lose interest.
