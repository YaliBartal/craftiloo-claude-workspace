It is very basic but good for young children to start with. They love sewing the animals together and stuffing them. The animal characters are cute. The sewing “needles” are kid friendly, they are a good size, plastic, with a blunt tip; perfect for kids.",

The quality was excellent.  It had the best instruction booklet I've seen.  Each craft project had its own easy to follow instructions for little one, with pictures showing step by step what was needed.  It even showed what color thread to use and what length to cut it.  It showed where to start sewing and where to stop to add the stuffing.  The package contained 4 sewing needles that were easy to thread.  The kit could easily be separated so more than one little one could work on these at the same time.  I would highly recommend.",

The finished product is something they can be really proud of and something that can be saved and cherished. And the selection of stuffies in the kit is fabulous. My granddaughter loved every single one. This kit has gotten us started on a project rabbit hole and now that’s our vibe when she comes to my house. It’s our thing now and something she really looks forward to and so do I. So needless to say I HIGHLY recommend this kit to parents and grandparents alike. My granddaughter adored it and she started out age 3, turned 4 during our journey through the kit and had a ton of fun. Definitely 5 stars, wish I could rate it MUCH MUCH higher tho. This would also make a fantastic gift.",

It was their first attempt at sewing anything, so they needed quite a bit of help with the 'concept' of how to use it but they stuck with it and were beyond thrilled with the cute results. I especially appreciated that it took them 3/4 hours to make all 8 stuffies and then, was able to gather the trash in the box and throw it all away - mess free! I highly recommend this craft kit to anyone with kids - it doesn't disappoint!",

        "content": "What a wonderful first sewing experience my granddaughters had with this sewing kit. The kit contained many different projects each one as adorable as the next. All of the materials were durable and well crafted. Prepunched holes, large needles and high quality felt allowed the children ages five and seven to work independently on their sewing projects. They were very proud of the decorative unicorn pillow and cat purse that they sewed all by themselves. Since the kit includes several projects we look forward to creating other designs. This sewing kit would be a great gift for children ages five and up.",

She literally said it was her favorite gift, and this was after celebrating both her birthday and Christmas on the same day! She is 7 years old and crafty, and it was so fun to see her put this craft together! The quality and design of the materials are also so perfect for this age. The cat purse is just too cute and I was surprised by the vibrancy of the color and the size of the cat purse (it was big!). With a little adult help she was able to really do quite a bit independently and the directions seemed manageable. I am so happy I bought this one and can have cool aunt status for a little while!",

        "content": "purchased for 9 year old who really wanted a sewing kit for Christmas.  great instructions.  exceptional quality. at first I thought it was a little bit expensive but the quality was good, the instructions were good, and the fun she had putting it together was amazing.  good value. so fun. these have prepunched holes which is what she needed for getting a start on sewing.  now she uses a regular needle and thread and makes fairies out of scraps of felt. I would definitely recommend this for the 7 - 12 year old age group.  I have a 7 year old who also made a fairy but had a little bit of difficulty, however, she got the hang of it but is not quite ready for regular needle and thread.",
