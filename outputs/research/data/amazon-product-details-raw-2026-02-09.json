      "text": "I recently purchased this embroidery kit as a beginner, and overall, it’s a great learning tool! The kit includes all necessary materials—nice embroidery floss, sturdy hoop, and printed fabric. One of the best features is the included instructional booklet, which is clear, easy to follow, and perfect for a first-time stitcher. It does contain a few minor typos such as “raw” in place of “row”. The accompanying tutorial videos are also a huge plus, making it easy to learn and practice different stitches step by step. However, there is one major flaw: \"Embroidery\" is misspelled on the fabric. Diphthong oi is a tough one! While this doesn’t affect the ability to learn the stitches, it does mean that the finished pieces aren’t really suitable for display or gifting. I contacted Craftiloo directly about this error. They were prompt in responding and working to correct the issue. If you’re looking for a kit to practice your stitching skills, this is a fantastic option!",

      "text": "The CRAFTILOO Latch Hook Kit for Kids Rug DIY Pillow Craft is a creative and engaging kit designed for young crafters, combining art, hands-on learning, and cozy décor. With precut yarn, an easy-to-follow pattern, and fun googly-eye designs, this kit allows kids (and even crafty adults!) to create a cute pillow or shelf decoration they’ll be proud of. Although this kit is geared toward 8–10-year-old children, we purchased it for our oldest granddaughter. She’s about to celebrate her birthday and officially become a teenager, and she’s excited to “age up” her room. I thought this would make a perfect bed pillow or shelf accent. I also can’t wait to show her how to latch hook—I used to do this as a child, and it brings back such fun memories! 🧶 Key Features 👉 Precut Yarn & Easy Hook – No measuring or cutting required; simple for beginners. 👉 Fun, Cute Designs – Includes hearts, googly eyes, and playful patterns kids love. 👉 Step-by-Step Instructions – Clear directions make the craft easy to follow. 👉 DIY Décor – Finished product doubles as a cozy pillow or charming room decoration. 👉 Ages 8+ – Perfect for tweens, though suitable for older crafters looking for a creative project. ✨ Pros ✅ Engaging & Creative – Encourages artistic expression and hands-on skills. ✅ Beginner-Friendly – Easy-to-follow instructions make it suitable for kids new to latch hooking. ✅ Room-Ready Craft – Finished product is a cute pillow or shelf piece that personalizes a room. ✅ Nostalgic Fun – Great for parents/grandparents to craft alongside kids and share skills. ❌ Cons ❌ Small Pieces – Some yarn strands may be tricky for younger hands; supervision recommended. ❌ Pattern Limited – Designs may feel a little basic for advanced crafters seeking more variety. ❌ Time Commitment – Completing the pillow takes patience; this is better as a weekend project than a quick craft. 💡 Final Thoughts The CRAFTILOO Latch Hook Kit is a delightful DIY activity that blends creativity, nostalgia, and room décor in one kit. While younger children may need some help, and the designs are simple, it’s perfect for a tween or teen looking to craft something cute and personal. For our granddaughter, it’s not just a craft—it’s a thoughtful birthday gift and a way to make her room feel uniquely hers. We’re excited to make this a new family tradition of creative fun!",

      "text": "Edit: The backing fabric does not wear well. This pillow has been finished for less than a month and had been a constant companion to my daughter, but she has already worn holes in the fabric. Original Review This kit is very cute and convenient for gifting. Overall it is pretty straightforward to use. The mesh is already sewn to the backing fabric. Once the latchhooking is done, simply release the vacuum seal on the fiberfill, unzip the pillow and load it up. The design is painted directly on the mesh making it a fun and easy project for kids from about ages 6+ depending on their motor skills. I will say that the yarn pieces are a bit short and thinner than I am used to and may be a bit harder for small hands to maneuver. The latchhook tool itself is pretty flimsy which is why I am only giving the kit 4 stars. I also find the eyes on the heart pillow to be a bit disturbing and wish I would have had the option to be choose the owl instead.",

So the variety is awesome. The board warps slightly when ironing but it’s still very usable afterwards. All my projects came out beautifully and they definitely are made to last. I really hope the seller makes it available to purchase one color of beads as I’m running out of black, white and dark green! Awesome product though, it’s truly helped put my hopes and dreams into reality, don’t think twice and buy it! Not only is it fun to do, but it’s awesome for concentration since the beads are so small and intricate. That said, definitely don’t buy the mini beads for kids😂 they might eat them.",

I’d say these melted better than the 5mm perler brand beads (of course size alone could be the difference) but I was super happy with the way these turned out. I’d buy again but I’d be careful to use the tape method next time. The grids just can’t stand the heat.",

The tweezers were weird, idk if I got a janky pair, or they’re meant to be that way, but the end was kind of deformed and I couldn’t pick up any beads with it. I already had some super pointy tweezers on hand for picking up crystals so I used those. This kit has a great variety of colors, and even extra baggies of black and white beads. It came with several peg boards, tweezers, and clear plastic ironing sheets. I never did perler/fuse beads as a kid, so this was a fun new craft for me. The mini beads are so small, but it’s a fun craft if you like precise, fiddly, time consuming activities. You need a certain amount of manual dexterity for this, but otherwise it’s just an easy repetitive activity. I made some shoe clips, each one took me about thirty minutes, and I’ll need more black beads for sure. I used a mini travel iron to melt my beads. FYI I tried loctite gel super glue to adhere my metal shoe clips to the plastic and it was an utter fail, but the e6000 did work, we’ll see how well it holds up once the glue has cured a bit more.",

They melt at a perfect speed, unlike other brands ive tried where the beads melt super fast and explode or warp from the heat, these keep their shape very nicely, and melt slowly enough to be able to see that the design is melting evenly while youre ironing them. They also come with the best tweezers ive gotten in a pack before, theyre very durable, and its really easy to hold onto the beads without dropping them or accidently flicking them around. The peg board is also very nice. in the past ive had issues with peg boards from other companies where for some reason it was almost impossible to get my creations off the board once they were ironed, but with these theyre always very easy to remove without breaking. and one more last thing i'd like to add; The customer service has been by far the best out of any companies ive ever reached out to, theyre super quick to respond and very kind.",

      "text": "My 8yo daughter has been wanting to learn how to sew, so we got her this sewing kit for Christmas. She loved it and was so excited to get started! We managed to get 3 done within a couple hours (with breaks, of course). And plan to finish up the last two today. The instructions were clear to follow and explain how to thread a needle, what type of stitches are used, etc. My daughter opted for the running stitch vs the whip stitch which I think was a good choice for little hands. There is plenty of the colored yarn, and I think we’ll have enough of the tan yarn if we’re careful on how much we use. We worked as a team - I held the pieces together and she stitched it all. I can see this being rather difficult for children younger than 8. I’d assume kiddos 9 and older could do this themselves. But doing it together is fairly simple and easy and my daughter really enjoyed doing them. She was so proud to show them to her Grandma yesterday. For beginners, this is a fun, easy set with all the supplies you need! I’d definitely buy again!",

I would definitely recommend this for the 7 - 12 year old age group. I have a 7 year old who also made a fairy but had a little bit of difficulty, however, she got the hang of it but is not quite ready for regular needle and thread.",

      "text": "I bought this Princess Lacing Card Kit for my super-energetic and active 3‑year‑old niece, who usually gets bored with toys in minutes. However, from the second she opened the box, she was absolutely absorbed in lacing the cards together. She loved the princess theme as she is very into the Disney princesses right now. The kit includes multiple lacing cards and colorful laces that are just the right size for little hands. What I really love is how it encouraged her to slow down and focus, which is a huge accomplishment for someone with such a short attention span. 😊 This lacing activity has helped her work on her fine motor skills and hand‑eye coordination (something we’ve been working on!) without feeling like learning or \"work.\" She enthusiastically and proudly “finished” each card and immediately asked for more, and even her parents noticed she stayed with this activity way longer than other toys and activities. This activity is simple, screen‑free fun that actually held her attention, which was a huge win! If you’re looking for a creative, hands-on, screen-free, and educational activity that keeps little hands and minds engaged and active, this is a great choice for toddlers around age 3 and up. Highly recommend!",

She spent well over an hour decorating the cards with stickers and making fun lacing designs. Now they’re an essential part of our “out and about” bag. They’ve kept her occupied in restaurants, the car, a plane ride, and even in the grocery store. My favorite part about them is that they’re reusable. The stickers don’t lose their stickiness after immediately using them, so you can put them right back on the sticker sheet to use for next time. If they do happen to lose their stick, just peel it off and put one of those adhesive glue dots on the back of the gem. Good as new. And in case you were wondering, they’re fun for all ages! They’ve kept me (27), my husband (31), my 5 year old, my 3 year old, and my grandma (76) entertained on many of our outings.",
