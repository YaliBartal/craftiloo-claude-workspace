## Key Decisions

- **First Barbie latch hook kit on Amazon** — no direct competitor
- **Title front-loads "Latch Hook Kit" (37K vol)** then "for Kids" (16.6K vol)
- **Barbie IP** is the primary differentiator in every image and bullet
- **Stuffing included** differentiates from LatchKits wall hangings
- **7 images** covering: hero, contents, process, result, age/safety, gift, brand trust
