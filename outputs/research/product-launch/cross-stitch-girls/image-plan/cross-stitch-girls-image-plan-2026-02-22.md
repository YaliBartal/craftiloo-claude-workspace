### Image Narrative Arc

The 7 images tell a complete purchase story: **ATTRACT** (Image 1 — beautiful product hero) → **INFORM** (Images 2-3 — what's inside, how easy it is) → **PROVE** (Images 4-5 — show results, show real use) → **CONVERT** (Images 6-7 — gift appeal, educational value). The buyer's emotional journey moves from "oh that's cute" → "my kid could do this" → "look what they'll make" → "this is the perfect gift."

### Copy Notes

- **Words customers use:** easy, cute, adorable, complete, gift, backpack charm, keychain, beginner, safe, fun, creative
- **Concerns to address visually:** Age suitability (show 8-12 year olds), kit completeness (show everything laid out), ease of use (show instructions/process), finished quality (show completed projects)

## Image-by-Image Detail

### Image 1: Hero / Main Product Shot

**Image Type:** Main/Hero — Product on white background
**Customer Question:** "What does it look like?"

#### Recommended Copy

**Text on This Image:**

| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| (none) | No text allowed on main image | Amazon requirement |

**Why no copy:** Amazon requires main images to have a pure white background with no text, graphics, or watermarks. The product must speak for itself.

#### Customer Insight Driving This Image
- First impression determines click-through rate
- Gift buyers want to see the packaging quality
- Box should suggest "gift-ready" even without text
- All 5 designs should be partially visible to communicate "5 projects"

#### Visual Approach Options

**Approach 1: Gift Box Open — Angled (Recommended)**
- Description: Gift box open at a 45-degree angle, showing all 5 cross stitch designs fanned out in their hoops. Colorful, inviting.
- Pros: Shows product count, gift-ready packaging, colorful designs — all in one shot. Communicates value and gift appeal.
- Cons: May not show individual design detail at thumbnail.

**Approach 2: Products Arranged — No Box**
- Description: All 5 finished cross stitch charms arranged in a circle or arc on white background, without the box.
- Pros: Shows finished product quality, each design is visible.
- Cons: Doesn't communicate "gift box" packaging. Looks like individual items, not a kit.

**Approach 3: Box + One Finished Charm**
- Description: Closed gift box with one completed charm (e.g., unicorn) clipped to a keychain sitting in front.
- Pros: Clean, simple, shows both packaging and finished result.
- Cons: Only shows 1 of 5 designs.

#### Recommended Visual Direction
- Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF)
- Product position: Gift box open at 45-degree angle, slightly elevated
- Props/Context: None (Amazon rule)
- Color palette: Let the product colors pop — pink/purple hoops, colorful floss
- Lighting: Bright, even studio lighting. No shadows beyond natural product shadow.

#### Photography/Design Brief
- Shot instructions: Overhead or slight angle. Gift box open, 5 designs visible. Each in its hoop.
- Styling: Designs should be fanned slightly so all 5 are partially visible
- Mobile thumbnail check: Must clearly read as "5 colorful items in a box" at thumbnail. The pink/purple hoops should be immediately visible.

#### Competitor Comparison (This Position)
- **Pllieay:** Shows kit contents loosely arranged on white — no box, looks scattered
- **KRAFUN:** Shows closed box with product image — clean but doesn't show what's inside
- **Caydo:** Shows products in hoops on white — similar to our approach
- **Our approach is better because:** Open gift box shows both "gift-ready" AND "5 projects" in one shot

### Image 2: What's Included (Complete Kit)

**Image Type:** Infographic / Flat Lay
**Customer Question:** "Is everything I need in the box?"

#### Recommended Copy

| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Complete Cross Stitch Kit — Everything Included" | Top center |
| Callout 1 | "5 Pre-Stamped Patterns" | Arrow pointing to fabric patterns |
| Callout 2 | "5 Colorful Hoops (2.75 inch)" | Arrow pointing to hoops |
| Callout 3 | "4 Safe Blunt-Tip Needles" | Arrow pointing to needles |
| Callout 4 | "2 Needle Threaders" | Arrow pointing to threaders (with highlight badge) |
| Callout 5 | "5 Keychain Clips" | Arrow pointing to clips |
| Callout 6 | "Embroidery Floss" | Arrow pointing to thread |
| Callout 7 | "Illustrated Instructions" | Arrow pointing to booklet |
| Badge | "No Extra Supplies Needed" | Bottom corner, small badge |

**Why this copy:** "Is everything included?" is the #1 customer question. 8 reviews specifically praise the "complete kit." Highlighting the needle threaders as a callout exploits Pllieay's weakness (their customers wish for threaders). "No Extra Supplies Needed" removes the #1 purchase barrier for gift buyers who don't know what cross stitch requires.

#### Alternative Copy Options

**Option A — Keyword/SEO Focus:**
- Headline: "Cross Stitch Kit for Kids — Complete Beginner Set"
- Supporting: Same callouts + "Embroidery Kit with Everything to Start"
- *Why: Maximizes Rufus indexing with "cross stitch kit for kids" and "beginner" and "embroidery kit" in the image text.*

**Option B — Emotional/Gift-Buyer Focus:**
- Headline: "Open the Box and Start Crafting — Everything Inside"
- Supporting: Same callouts + "Gift-Ready — Nothing Else to Buy"
- *Why: Speaks to grandparents who worry about buying additional supplies. "Open the box and start" removes friction.*

**Option C — Practical/Informational Focus:**
- Headline: "What's in the Box — 5 Complete Project Sets"
- Supporting: Same callouts + "Each project includes: pattern + hoop + floss + clip"
- *Why: Directly answers the #1 Q&A question with maximum specificity. Shows each project is self-contained.*

**Option D — Differentiation Focus:**
- Headline: "More Included Than Other Kits"
- Supporting: Same callouts + "Includes 2 Needle Threaders (Most Kits Don't)" with highlight on threaders
- *Why: Exploits competitive gap — Pllieay customers specifically wish for threaders. We include them. This is a provable differentiator.*

#### Customer Insight Driving This Image
- "Everything you need" / "complete kit" mentioned in 8 reviews (16%) with avg 4.6 stars
- "Only 4 of the 5 patterns were in the box" — 3 reviews (6%) mention missing contents → showing ALL contents preempts this concern
- Pllieay review: "Wonderful but wish it would come with a needle threader!" — we include 2
- Gift buyers need to know nothing else is required — they often don't know what cross stitch needs

#### Visual Approach Options

**Approach 1: Labeled Flat Lay (Recommended)**
- Description: All kit contents laid out neatly on white/light surface with callout labels pointing to each item
- Pros: Clear, scannable, answers the question instantly. Standard Amazon format shoppers expect.
- Cons: Can look generic if not styled well.

**Approach 2: Organized Compartments**
- Description: Contents organized in themed groups (stitching tools, patterns, finishing accessories) with section labels
- Pros: Shows organization and thought behind the kit.
- Cons: More complex to shoot, may be harder to read at thumbnail.

**Approach 3: Exploded View from Box**
- Description: Gift box in center with all contents "exploding" outward in a radial layout
- Pros: Dynamic, eye-catching. Shows the box AND contents.
- Cons: May look cluttered at thumbnail size.

#### Recommended Visual Direction
- Background: White or very light pink (#FFF5F5) to stay on-brand
- Product position: Flat lay, evenly spaced. Gift box at top or center.
- Props/Context: None — pure product contents display
- Color palette: Let the colorful hoops (pink, purple, blue) create visual interest
- Lighting: Bright, even, no harsh shadows

#### Photography/Design Brief
- Shot instructions: Overhead flat lay. All items spaced evenly with breathing room. Gift box partially visible at edge.
- Styling: Group related items (hoops together, patterns fanned, clips lined up). Needle threaders should be positioned prominently — this is our competitive advantage.
- Text overlay placement: Headline at top. Callout arrows from labels to items. Badge bottom-right corner.
- Mobile thumbnail check: Headline must be readable. The quantity of items visible should communicate "lots of stuff included."

#### Competitor Comparison (This Position)
- **Pllieay:** Shows contents but without clear labeling — looks like a pile of supplies
- **KRAFUN:** Lists contents on packaging image — text-heavy, hard to read
- **Caydo:** Similar flat lay approach but with fewer items (appears less complete)
- **Our approach is better because:** Clear labels + competitive callout (threaders) + "No Extra Supplies" badge removes gift buyer anxiety

### Image 3: How It Works (Easy to Follow)

**Image Type:** Process / Step-by-Step Infographic
**Customer Question:** "Is it easy enough for my child?"

#### Recommended Copy

| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Beginner-Friendly — Pre-Stamped Patterns Show Every Stitch" | Top center |
| Step 1 | "1. Choose a Pattern" | Left third, with image of 5 patterns fanned |
| Step 2 | "2. Follow the Stamps" | Center, with close-up of stamped pattern |
| Step 3 | "3. Clip & Wear" | Right third, with finished charm on clip |
| Badge | "Ages 8-12 · No Experience Needed" | Bottom center |

**Why this copy:** Ease of use is our #1 praise theme (36% of reviews, 18 mentions). "Pre-stamped" is the key feature that makes it easy — reviewers specifically praise this. The 3-step process makes it look achievable. "No Experience Needed" addresses the beginner concern directly.

#### Alternative Copy Options

**Option A — Keyword/SEO Focus:**
- Headline: "Beginner Cross Stitch Kit — Easy Step-by-Step Instructions"
- Supporting: Same 3 steps + "Needlepoint Kit for Kids Ages 8-12"
- *Why: Front-loads "beginner cross stitch kit" for Rufus indexing. Adds "needlepoint" as secondary keyword.*

**Option B — Emotional/Gift-Buyer Focus:**
- Headline: "So Easy, Kids Start on Their Own"
- Supporting: Same 3 steps + "Clear instructions — most 8+ year olds pick it up in minutes"
- *Why: "Start on their own" addresses the grandparent worry about whether they'll need to help. Uses actual review language: "9-year-old learned quickly."*

**Option C — Practical/Informational Focus:**
- Headline: "How It Works — 3 Simple Steps"
- Supporting: "Step 1: Choose from 5 pre-stamped patterns · Step 2: Follow the printed guide — every stitch marked · Step 3: Snap into keychain clip and wear it"
- *Why: Maximum information, minimum fluff. Directly explains the process for buyers who don't know what cross stitch is.*

**Option D — Differentiation Focus:**
- Headline: "Pre-Stamped — No Guesswork, No Counting"
- Supporting: Same 3 steps + "Unlike plain-grid kits, every stitch position is marked"
- *Why: Addresses a key competitor weakness — Pllieay and Caydo reviews mention confusing patterns. Our pre-stamped approach eliminates this.*

#### Customer Insight Driving This Image
- "Easy to follow" / "clear instructions" mentioned in 18 reviews (36%) — our #1 strength
- "9 yr old learned quickly" — customer quote showing age-appropriate ease
- "This cross stitch kit is NOT for children" — 4 reviews mention age concerns → this image MUST show it IS for children by demonstrating simplicity
- "The instructions are limited for someone who has never done cross stitch" — 2 reviews want more detail → showing the pre-stamped pattern addresses this
- If we don't show ease-of-use, hesitant buyers default to the competitor with the most "easy" messaging

#### Visual Approach Options

**Approach 1: 3-Panel Step Process (Recommended)**
- Description: Three panels side by side showing Choose → Stitch → Wear progression
- Pros: Clear narrative, shows the full journey from start to finished product. Shoppers can visualize their child doing this.
- Cons: Each panel is small — detail may be lost at thumbnail.

**Approach 2: Close-Up of Stamped Pattern**
- Description: Large close-up showing the pre-stamped fabric with clear stitch marks, plus a small inset of the finished result
- Pros: Proves "pre-stamped" claim with visual evidence. Shows exactly what the child sees.
- Cons: Technical — may not resonate emotionally with gift buyers who don't know cross stitch.

**Approach 3: Child Actively Stitching (Lifestyle)**
- Description: Hands of an 8-10 year old girl following the pattern, with instruction booklet visible nearby
- Pros: Lifestyle proof that a real child can do this. Emotionally compelling.
- Cons: Requires model/lifestyle photography. May look staged.

#### Recommended Visual Direction
- Background: White or soft gradient. Clean and simple.
- Product position: 3 panels with clear step numbers. Patterns visible in step 1, close-up of stamped fabric in step 2, finished charm on keychain in step 3.
- Props/Context: Instruction booklet visible. Maybe a child's hand holding the needle (if lifestyle elements allowed).
- Color palette: Consistent with brand — pink/purple accents.
- Lighting: Bright, clean.

#### Photography/Design Brief
- Shot instructions: Shoot each step separately, then composite into 3-panel infographic. Step 2 needs a macro close-up of the stamped pattern fabric showing the printed guide marks.
- Styling: Keep each panel simple and focused. The progression should read left-to-right like a story.
- Text overlay placement: Headline at top spanning full width. Step numbers in circles above each panel.
- Mobile thumbnail check: The "3 steps" and "Ages 8-12" badge must be readable at thumbnail. The visual progression left→right should be clear.

#### Competitor Comparison (This Position)
- **Pllieay:** No clear "how it works" image — jumps straight to contents
- **KRAFUN:** Shows pre-punched felt close-up — effective but different technique
- **Caydo:** No process image
- **Our approach is better because:** 3-step visual makes the process look achievable. None of our direct competitors show a clear step-by-step process.

| Callout | "Each fits a 2.75-inch hoop" | Bottom, small text |

**Why this copy:** "Cute" / "adorable designs" is our #2 praise theme (28% of reviews). Naming each design helps buyers visualize the variety. "Kids Love to Make" uses emotional language tied to review evidence. Size callout answers the implicit question about project size.

**Option A — Keyword/SEO Focus:**
- Headline: "5 Cross Stitch Patterns for Kids — Heart, Unicorn, Cat, Rainbow, Owl"
- Supporting: "Pre-Stamped Beginner Embroidery Designs · 2.75-Inch Hoops"

**Option B — Emotional/Gift-Buyer Focus:**

**Option C — Practical/Informational Focus:**
- Headline: "5 Complete Projects in One Kit"
- Supporting: Design labels + "Each includes: stamped pattern + matching hoop + floss + keychain clip"
- *Why: Emphasizes value (5 projects per kit) and that each is self-contained. Answers "how many projects?"*

#### Customer Insight Driving This Image
- "Cute" / "adorable designs" — 14 reviews (28%), avg 4.7 stars
- "She was excited to work on the cat first" — direct customer quote showing design appeal
- "My 8 year old granddaughter loved it!" — design variety drives excitement
- Finished result quality concerns (from competitor reviews) → showing our clean, professional results builds confidence
- If buyers don't see the finished result, they can't visualize the gift value

#### Visual Approach Options

**Approach 1: 5 Charms Arranged (Recommended)**
- Description: All 5 completed charms arranged in an arc or circle on a clean background, each labeled
- Pros: Shows all 5 designs clearly. Communicates variety and value.
- Cons: Individual designs may be small.

**Approach 2: Grid Layout with Close-Ups**
- Description: 5-panel grid, each panel showing one design in detail with its name
- Pros: Each design gets attention. Shows stitch detail/quality.
- Cons: May feel more like a catalog than an emotional sell.

**Approach 3: Lifestyle — Charms on Display**
- Description: 5 completed charms displayed on a cute corkboard, hanging display, or clipped to a miniature backpack
- Pros: Shows them in context. Emotionally appealing.
- Cons: May not clearly show each individual design.

#### Recommended Visual Direction
- Background: White or very soft pastel gradient
- Product position: 5 completed charms in an arc, each slightly overlapping for a dynamic feel. Labels floating next to each.
- Props/Context: None — pure product focus
- Color palette: The designs themselves provide color (pink hearts, rainbow, etc.)
- Lighting: Bright, even, making colors pop

#### Photography/Design Brief
- Shot instructions: Flat lay or slight angle. Each charm in its colored hoop with keychain clip attached.
- Styling: Arrange in a pleasing arc — heart at center (most popular), others flanking. Each design should face the viewer.
- Text overlay placement: Headline top. Labels beside each charm. Size callout bottom.
- Mobile thumbnail check: "5" items must be clearly countable at thumbnail. The variety of colors should communicate "multiple designs."

#### Competitor Comparison (This Position)
- **Pllieay:** Shows their 6 designs but small and hard to distinguish
- **KRAFUN:** Shows 4 felt keyrings — clear but fewer projects
- **Caydo:** Shows 5 designs — similar approach
- **Our approach is better because:** Cleaner presentation with labels. 5 designs (more than KRAFUN's 4). Named designs create emotional connection.

### Image 5: In Use (Backpack Charms)

**Image Type:** Lifestyle / Use-case
**Customer Question:** "Can kids actually use/wear these?"

#### Recommended Copy

| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Backpack Charms & Keychains Kids Wear Every Day" | Top |
| Callout 1 | "Clips to Backpacks" | Near backpack |
| Callout 2 | "Pencil Cases" | Near pencil case |
| Callout 3 | "Jacket Zippers" | Near jacket |
| Supporting | "Make 5 — Keep Your Favorites & Share with Friends" | Bottom |

**Why this copy:** This is Craftiloo's #1 differentiator — wearable results. 4+ reviews specifically praise the backpack charm use case. No competitor emphasizes this as strongly. "Kids Wear Every Day" is informative and factual. "Share with Friends" adds social proof and value (5 is enough to share).

#### Alternative Copy Options

**Option A — Keyword/SEO Focus:**
- Headline: "Cross Stitch Keychains & Backpack Charms for Kids"
- Supporting: "Clip Finished Embroidery Projects to Bags, Cases & Jackets"
- *Why: Indexes "cross stitch keychains" (775 vol) and "backpack charms" — both specific product-type keywords.*

**Option B — Emotional/Gift-Buyer Focus:**
- Headline: "The Craft Kit They'll Show Off to Friends"
- Supporting: "Finished projects clip to backpacks — friends always ask where they got them"
- *Why: Taps into social pride and validation. Gift buyers want to give something the child will USE, not shelve.*

**Option C — Practical/Informational Focus:**
- Headline: "5 Usable Projects — Not Just Display Pieces"
- Supporting: "Strong keychain clips attach to backpacks, pencil cases, jacket zippers, and bags"
- *Why: Addresses the practicality question directly. "Not Just Display Pieces" differentiates from competitor kits where finished items have no use.*

#### Customer Insight Driving This Image
- "Backpack charms" / "keychains" mentioned in 4+ reviews as a key selling point
- "The finished projects can be used as keychains and decorative items" — existing listing already mentions this
- "Grandsons loves these, he's 10 and loves crafting for gifts for his mom" — kids sharing/gifting the results
- No competitor shows finished products in real-world USE (on an actual backpack)
- If we don't show this, buyers assume finished projects sit unused — missing our biggest differentiator

#### Visual Approach Options

**Approach 1: Backpack Close-Up (Recommended)**
- Description: Close-up of a child's backpack with 2-3 completed cross stitch charms clipped on, plus a pencil case nearby with one more
- Pros: Proves the use case with visual evidence. Aspirational — kids see themselves wearing these.
- Cons: Requires lifestyle photography. Product is small in frame.

**Approach 2: Multi-Use Grid**
- Description: 3 panels showing different use cases: backpack, pencil case, jacket zipper
- Pros: Shows versatility. Each use case gets dedicated space.
- Cons: More design-heavy. May feel less authentic than lifestyle.

**Approach 3: Flat Lay with Accessories**
- Description: Charms laid out next to a backpack, pencil case, and jacket — showing what they'll clip to
- Pros: Clean, product-focused while showing context.
- Cons: Less emotionally compelling than seeing them actually clipped on.

#### Recommended Visual Direction
- Background: Lifestyle setting — school hallway, bedroom, or simple colored backdrop
- Product position: 2-3 charms clipped to a real backpack in use, one on a pencil case
- Props/Context: Kid's backpack (colorful, age-appropriate), pencil case, jacket or hoodie
- Color palette: Warm, inviting. The charms should pop against the backpack color.
- Lighting: Natural or warm studio lighting. Not clinical.

#### Photography/Design Brief
- Shot instructions: Close-up of charms clipped onto a real backpack (not a staged product-on-white). Show the clips actually attached.
- Styling: Use a child's backpack that matches the target demographic (8-12 year old girl). Multiple charms visible.
- Text overlay placement: Headline top. Callouts pointing to different use cases. Supporting text at bottom.
- Mobile thumbnail check: The colorful charms on the backpack must be visible at thumbnail. The "on a real backpack" context should be clear.

#### Competitor Comparison (This Position)
- **Pllieay:** Shows finished items but not in use — they just sit in hoops
- **KRAFUN:** Shows felt keyrings but not clipped to anything
- **Caydo:** No in-use image
- **Our approach is better because:** ONLY WE show the product in real-world use. This is our biggest competitive gap exploitation.

### Image 6: Gift Appeal

**Image Type:** Lifestyle / Gift Scene
**Customer Question:** "Is this a good gift?"

#### Recommended Copy

| Callout 3 | "Builds Fine Motor Skills" | Bottom callout |
| Supporting | "Birthday · Christmas · Easter · Rainy Day Fun" | Bottom |

**Why this copy:** 40% of all reviews mention gift-giving. The dominant buyer is a grandparent buying for a granddaughter. "Gift-Ready Box" tells them no wrapping needed. "Screen-Free" is a powerful parent/grandparent trigger (3+ reviews). Occasion list covers the top purchase triggers. "Builds Fine Motor Skills" adds educational justification for the purchase.

**Option D — Differentiation Focus:**

- Supporting: "5 Quick Projects, Each Becomes a Backpack Charm"
- *Why: Addresses the unspoken concern: "Will my grandchild actually use this?" Competitors can't promise wearable results.*

#### Customer Insight Driving This Image
- 40% of reviews mention gift-giving — this is the DOMINANT purchase context
- "My 8 year old granddaughter loved it!" — grandparent buyer, 5 stars
- "Bought this for my great-granddaughter for her birthday" — birthday gift context
- "I bought this kit for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas" — holiday gift context
- "Screen-free" mentioned in 3+ reviews as a purchase trigger
- If we don't show gift appeal, we lose the 40% of buyers who are buying gifts

#### Visual Approach Options

**Approach 1: Gift-Giving Scene (Recommended)**
- Description: Beautifully styled gift box (our box) with a ribbon, alongside a birthday card or holiday context
- Pros: Communicates "gift-ready" instantly. Aspirational for gift buyers.
- Cons: Seasonal — may need variants for different holidays.

**Approach 2: Child Opening Gift**
- Description: 8-10 year old girl opening the gift box with excitement
- Pros: Emotionally powerful. Shows the reaction the gift buyer hopes for.
- Cons: Requires model photography. May date the image.

**Approach 3: Occasion Collage**
- Description: Small images showing the kit in different contexts: birthday party, under Christmas tree, rainy day at home
- Pros: Covers multiple occasions. Shows versatility of gift timing.
- Cons: Each scene is small. May look busy.

#### Recommended Visual Direction
- Background: Warm, inviting — soft pastel or holiday-neutral (works year-round)
- Product position: Gift box prominently centered, slightly open to show contents peeking out
- Props/Context: Subtle gift wrapping elements (ribbon, tissue paper, birthday confetti)
- Color palette: Warm pinks, purples, golds — gift-evoking
- Lighting: Warm, soft, inviting

#### Photography/Design Brief
- Shot instructions: Gift box hero with festive styling. NOT overtly Christmas — should work year-round. Think "celebration" not "specific holiday."
- Styling: Ribbon across box. Maybe tissue paper peeking out. One charm completed and lying beside the box as a "preview."
- Text overlay placement: Headline top. Badges in corners. Occasion list at bottom.
- Mobile thumbnail check: Gift box + "Gift-Ready" headline must be readable. The image should "feel" like a gift even at small size.

#### Competitor Comparison (This Position)
- **Pllieay:** No gift-specific image
- **KRAFUN:** Has gift messaging in title but no dedicated gift image
- **Caydo:** Gift box visible in hero shot but no dedicated image
- **Our approach is better because:** Dedicated gift image speaks directly to the 40% of buyers purchasing as a gift. No competitor has this.

- Supporting: "Each project takes 1-2 hours · 5 projects = 5-10 hours of screen-free engagement"
- *Why: Quantifies the value. Parents calculating cost-per-hour of entertainment. "5-10 hours" is compelling math.*

#### Customer Insight Driving This Image
- "Keeps her busy and off her screens" — 5.0★ review, powerful parent trigger
- "Great teaching tool to introduce cross stitch to a young person" — educational framing
- "It was a great teaching tool" / "educational value" — 10 reviews (20%)
- "Fine motor skills" specifically mentioned as a benefit
- This image serves as the final "permission to buy" — the educational justification that tips a hesitant gift buyer over the edge

#### Visual Approach Options

**Approach 1: Benefits Infographic (Recommended)**
- Description: Clean infographic with 4 benefit icons in a row, child stitching in background or small inset
- Pros: Clear, scannable, benefit-focused. Standard Amazon format.
- Cons: May feel less emotional than a lifestyle shot.

**Approach 2: Child Stitching — Focused (Lifestyle)**
- Description: Child (8-10 year old) actively cross stitching at a table, engaged and focused. Benefits overlaid as text.
- Pros: Shows a real child engaged. Emotionally compelling — the buyer sees their grandchild.
- Cons: Requires model photography. Benefits may be lost behind the lifestyle.

**Approach 3: Before/After Split**
- Description: Split image: Left = child on tablet/phone (greyed out). Right = child cross stitching (colorful, happy).
- Pros: VERY powerful "screen-free" messaging. Visual contrast is immediately understood.
- Cons: Showing a child on a screen may feel judgmental. Could alienate some buyers.

#### Recommended Visual Direction
- Background: Clean, bright. Soft gradient or white.
- Product position: Small inset of product/child stitching. Main focus is the benefit icons and text.
- Props/Context: If including a child, age 8-10, engaged in stitching. No screens visible.
- Color palette: Educational feel — blues, greens, with brand pinks/purples
- Lighting: Bright, optimistic

#### Photography/Design Brief
- Shot instructions: Primarily designed/infographic. 4 benefit icons with text labels. Small lifestyle inset of engaged child optional.
- Styling: Icons should be simple, recognizable (hand for fine motor, brain/clock for focus, palette for creativity, grid for pattern recognition).
- Text overlay placement: Headline top. 4 benefits in a horizontal row. Supporting text at bottom.
- Mobile thumbnail check: "Screen-Free" must be readable at thumbnail. The overall message of "educational benefits" should be clear even small.

#### Competitor Comparison (This Position)
- **Pllieay:** No educational/benefits image
- **KRAFUN:** Some benefit messaging in other images but no dedicated benefits image
- **Caydo:** No benefits image
- **Our approach is better because:** ONLY WE dedicate a full image to educational benefits. This is the conversion closer for hesitant gift buyers.

## Alternative Image Sequences

### Current Recommended Order
1. **Hero** — First impression, click-through
2. **What's Included** — Answer #1 question immediately
3. **How It Works** — Build confidence in ease
4. **The Results** — Show what they'll create
5. **In Use** — Prove it's wearable (differentiator)
6. **Gift Appeal** — Speak to gift buyers
7. **Educational** — Final conversion push

### Alternative Order A — Gift-Buyer First

1. Hero
2. **Gift Appeal** (moved from 6 → 2) — Speaks to dominant buyer persona immediately
3. What's Included
4. How It Works
5. The Results
6. In Use
7. Educational

**Rationale:** If 40% of buyers are gift purchasers, hitting them with gift messaging in position 2 (highest engagement after hero) may increase conversions. Trade-off: delays the "what's included" answer.

**Best for:** Q4 (holiday season), when gift buyers spike.

### Alternative Order B — Results First

1. Hero
2. **The Results** (moved from 4 → 2) — Show outcome immediately
3. **In Use** (moved from 5 → 3) — Prove they're wearable
4. What's Included
5. How It Works
6. Gift Appeal
7. Educational

**Rationale:** Leading with the finished product creates desire FIRST, then answers practical questions. This is the "aspiration-first" approach. Trade-off: delays practical information that some buyers need to build confidence.

**Best for:** Shoppers who browse visually and make emotional decisions.

### Competitor Image Analysis

#### Overview Table

| Competitor | ASIN | Strengths | Weaknesses | Text Strategy |
|------------|------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Pllieay | B08T5QC9FS | Multiple product images, shows variety | No lifestyle, no in-use, no gift, no benefits, no clear labeling | Minimal text — mostly product-on-white |
| KRAFUN | B0B7JHN4F1 | Shows pre-punched felt close-up (good proof), clean images | Only 4 projects shown, no in-use images, no gift appeal | Some text overlays — feature-focused |
| Caydo | B0CM9JKNCC | Shows contents clearly, gift box in hero | Low image count, no lifestyle, no educational benefits | Basic text — product names only |

#### Position-by-Position Competitor Comparison

| Position | Pllieay | KRAFUN | Caydo | Our Approach | Why Different |
|----------|---------|--------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 (Hero) | Contents on white | Closed box + product image | Products in hoops | Open gift box showing 5 designs | Shows gift-ready + quantity in one shot |
| 2 | Contents detail | Contents close-up | Contents flat lay | Labeled contents infographic | Clear labels + competitive callout (threaders) |
| 3 | Pattern close-up | Felt close-up (pre-punched) | — | 3-step process infographic | Shows HOW it works, not just WHAT it looks like |
| 4 | Multiple designs | 4 keyrings displayed | — | 5 named designs showcase | Labeled designs create emotional connection |

| 6 | — | — | — | Gift-giving scene | No competitor has dedicated gift image |
| 7 | — | — | — | Educational benefits | No competitor shows educational value |

### Gaps We're Exploiting

1. **No competitor shows finished products in real-world use** (on a backpack, pencil case) — our Image 5 is completely unique in the category
2. **No competitor has a dedicated gift image** — despite gift-giving being the dominant purchase context (40% of reviews)
3. **No competitor shows educational benefits** — parents and grandparents want to justify "toy" purchases as "educational"
4. **No competitor highlights needle threaders** — Pllieay customers wish for them. We include 2 and call it out.
5. **No competitor shows a clear step-by-step process** — all show what's in the kit but not how easy it is to use
6. **"Screen-free" messaging is absent from all competitor images** — despite being one of the strongest purchase triggers in reviews
