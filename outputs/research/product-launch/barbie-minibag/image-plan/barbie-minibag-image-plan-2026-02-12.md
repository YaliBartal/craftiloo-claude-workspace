### Copy Guidelines

- **Voice:** Warm, confident, parent-informing. Factual, not kitschy.
- **Key phrases from reviews:** "everything included", "easy to follow", "kept her busy", "she was so proud", "great gift", "screen-free"
- **Words customers use:** complete, beginner, safe, easy, fun, creative, gift-ready, Barbie
- **Concerns to address:** Enough thread (show 5 colors), safe needles (show blunt tip), clear instructions (show booklet), functional result (show finished bag being carried)

### Copy Rules Applied
1. Informative over catchy — every headline answers a real question
2. Keyword-aware — "sewing kit", "kids ages 5-12", "Barbie", "complete kit" all Rufus-indexable
3. Matches listing voice — same vocabulary as bullet points
4. One topic per image — each image addresses ONE concern
5. Mobile-readable — short headlines, scannable callouts

### Image 2: What's Included (Flat Lay)

**Image Type:** Infographic / Flat Lay
**Customer Question:** "Does it come with everything needed?"

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Complete Sewing Kit — Nothing Else Needed" | Top center |
| Callout 1 | "5-Color Embroidery Floss" | Arrow pointing to floss bundle |
| Callout 2 | "Plastic Needle & Threader" | Arrow pointing to needle |
| Callout 3 | "Decorative Stickers" | Arrow pointing to stickers |

| Callout 5 | "Illustrated Booklet" | Arrow pointing to booklet |
| Callout 6 | "Pre-Cut Felt Bag Pieces" | Arrow pointing to felt |
| Callout 7 | "2 Strings" | Arrow pointing to strings |

**Why this copy:** "Does it come with everything?" is the most-asked question across all competitor Q&A. Customers want to see exactly what's in the box before buying. "Nothing Else Needed" directly addresses the worry that they'll need to buy extra supplies.

**Visual Elements:**
- Background: Soft pink or light Barbie-themed gradient
- All components laid out neatly in a flat lay arrangement
- Each item labeled with a clean callout line/arrow
- Barbie box visible in corner for branding

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- Clean, organized flat lay — each item spaced evenly

### Image 3: Finished Result (Lifestyle)

**Image Type:** Lifestyle / Result
**Customer Question:** "What does the finished bag look like? Can you actually use it?"

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Sew a Real Mini Bag Kids Can Carry" | Top or bottom bar |
| Supporting text | "Functional Bag — Not Just a Craft Project" | Below headline |
| Callout | "Personalize with Stickers & Buttons" | Near decoration detail |

**Why this copy:** Customers of kids' sewing kits commonly ask if the finished product is functional or just decorative. The phrase "real mini bag kids can carry" came directly from the top benefit that differentiates BB04 from plush/pillow competitor kits. "Not Just a Craft Project" reframes expectations.

**Visual Elements:**
- Child (girl, age 7-9) holding or wearing the finished Barbie mini bag
- Bag shown in use — slung over shoulder or carried in hand
- Bright, cheerful setting (park, bedroom, or playdate scenario)
- Close-up detail of sticker/button decorations visible on bag

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- Child model should look proud/happy — this image sells the emotional payoff
- Show the bag clearly — it should look like a real, functional bag
- Natural lighting preferred
- Barbie color palette in wardrobe or setting

### Image 4: How It Works (Step-by-Step)

**Image Type:** Infographic / Process
**Customer Question:** "Are instructions easy to follow? Is it hard?"

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Beginner-Friendly — No Sewing Experience Needed" | Top center |
| Step 1 | "Thread the Needle (Threader Included)" | Left panel, with photo |
| Step 2 | "Stitch the Pre-Cut Felt Pieces" | Center panel, with photo |
| Step 3 | "Decorate with Stickers & Buttons" | Right panel, with photo |
| Bottom text | "Illustrated Step-by-Step Booklet Included" | Bottom bar |

**Why this copy:** "Are instructions easy to follow?" and "Does my child need adult help?" are among the top 5 most-asked questions. The 3-step visual proves simplicity at a glance. "No Sewing Experience Needed" and "Threader Included" proactively address the top review complaints about threading difficulty.

**Visual Elements:**
- 3-panel layout showing sequential steps
- Each panel: close-up photo of child's hands doing that step
- Numbered circles (1, 2, 3) for clear sequence
- Clean white or soft pink background

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- Hands should be child-sized (not adult)
- Each step should look achievable and non-intimidating
- Show the threader being used in Step 1 (addresses threading complaint)
- Show the booklet open to a page with clear illustrations

### Image 5: Age & Safety

**Image Type:** Infographic
**Customer Question:** "What age is this for? Are the needles safe?"

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Safe Sewing Kit for Kids Ages 5-12" | Top center |
| Callout 1 | "Plastic Blunt-Tip Needle" | Near needle close-up |
| Callout 2 | "Pre-Cut Felt — No Scissors Needed" | Near felt pieces |
| Callout 3 | "Illustrated Step-by-Step Booklet" | Near booklet |
| Badge | "Ages 5-12" | Corner badge/circle |

**Why this copy:** Safety is the #3 concern after contents and age suitability. Parents and grandparents need reassurance that needles won't hurt their child. "Plastic Blunt-Tip Needle" uses factual, informative language. "No Scissors Needed" removes a secondary safety worry parents didn't even know they had.

**Visual Elements:**
- Close-up of the plastic needle next to a child's hand (shows scale, shows blunt tip)
- Pre-cut felt pieces arranged neatly (shows no cutting required)
- Open booklet showing illustrated instructions
- Age badge in Barbie pink

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- The needle close-up is the hero element — make the blunt tip obvious
- Compare plastic needle to regular needle if space allows (visual safety proof)
- Clean, informative layout — this is a trust-building image

### Image 6: Gift / Lifestyle

**Image Type:** Lifestyle / Gift
**Customer Question:** "Is this a good gift? Is the packaging nice?"

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Official Barbie Licensed Craft Kit" | Top or overlay |
| Callout 1 | "Gift-Ready Color Box" | Near box shot |
| Callout 2 | "Screen-Free Creative Activity" | Mid section |
| Callout 3 | "Birthday · Holiday · Rainy Day" | Bottom bar |

**Why this copy:** Gift buyers (grandparents and parents) are the primary purchaser. They need to see that this is a premium, licensed Barbie product with packaging nice enough to give without re-wrapping. "Screen-Free" addresses the #1 emotional trigger for gift-buying adults. Listing occasions (birthday, holiday, rainy day) expands perceived use cases.

**Visual Elements:**
- Barbie color box shown in gift context (wrapped with ribbon, under tree, or being handed to excited child)
- OR: child opening the box with delighted expression
- Warm, inviting setting — living room, birthday party, holiday scene

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- The box IS the product in gift context — make it look premium
- Barbie branding should be clearly visible and sharp
- Warm lighting, lifestyle feel
- Consider split image: box on left, happy child crafting on right

### Image 7: Barbie Brand / Collection

**Image Type:** Brand / Collection
**Customer Question:** "Is this real Barbie? What other Barbie kits exist?"

**Text on This Image:**

|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Officially Licensed Barbie Product" | Top center |
| Supporting text | "Barbie-Themed Felt & Packaging" | Below headline |
| CTA | "Collect All Barbie Craft Kits" | Bottom center |

**Why this copy:** The Barbie license is BB04's #1 differentiator. This image reinforces authenticity and invites buyers to explore the full Barbie craft line (BB01-BB08). "Officially Licensed" builds trust and justifies the premium. "Collect All" drives cross-selling.

**Visual Elements:**
- Barbie logo prominently displayed
- BB04 box front and center
- Other Barbie craft kits (BB01-BB08) shown smaller around it or in a row
- OR: Barbie-themed visual border with product feature callouts

**Photography/Design Notes:**

- Use official Barbie colors (pink, magenta, white)

### Competitor Image Analysis

| Competitor | ASIN | Images Used | Strengths | Weaknesses | Text Strategy |
|------------|------|------------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| KRAFUN | B091GXM2Y6 | 7: Hero, contents flat lay, lifestyle, process, age, gift, multi-project | Clean infographics, strong flat lay | Generic design, no branding power | Informative callouts, numbered steps |
| Klever Kits | B0CTTMWXYP | 7: Hero, flat lay, lifestyle, steps, unicorn theme, gift, variety | Colorful themes, good process shots | Busy layouts, text heavy | Mixed — some catchy, some informative |

### Gaps We're Exploiting

1. **No competitor has licensed character branding** — BB04's Barbie license is unique and immediately recognizable at thumbnail size
2. **No competitor emphasizes functional output** — Most kits make plush/decorative items; BB04 makes a usable bag
3. **Most competitors show generic craft process** — BB04 can show Barbie-branded process with Barbie-themed materials
4. **Gift packaging is undersold** — Competitors show box as afterthought; BB04 can lead with Barbie gift box appeal
5. **Safety is mentioned but not shown** — Most competitors write about safety; BB04 can visually demonstrate the blunt needle close-up
6. **Collection/cross-sell is absent** — No competitor shows a product family; BB04 can leverage the 8-kit Barbie line
