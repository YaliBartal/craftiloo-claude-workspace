## Market Landscape

### Direct Competition (Bag/Purse Sewing Kits)
Limited direct competition for **licensed Barbie bag sewing kits** on Amazon. Bag-specific sewing kits exist but none carry character licensing. The broader "sewing kit for kids" niche is dominated by stuffed animal/plush projects.

**Opportunity:** BB04 fills a gap — licensed character + functional bag output in kids sewing category.
