### Copy Guidelines Applied

- **Voice:** Informative, factual, listing-style. Same tone as the product bullet points. Written for the adult buyer (parent/grandparent), not the child.
- **Rufus optimization:** Every text block contains indexable keywords — "embroidery kit", "Barbie", "ages 8+", "beginner", "screen-free", "gift-ready", "waterproof", "complete kit"
- **No kitschy language:** No "Stitch Your Way to Fun!", no "The Ultimate Barbie Experience!", no "She'll Love It!" Instead: factual statements that answer questions and contain search terms.
- **Matches listing bullets:** Text mirrors the existing bullet point tone and vocabulary:
  - Listing says: *"OFFICIAL BARBIE CRAFT KIT FOR GIRLS"*
  - Image says: *"8 Barbie-Themed Embroidery Designs Included"*
  - Listing says: *"COMPLETE EMBROIDERY KIT INCLUDES"*
  - Image says: *"Complete Barbie Embroidery Kit — Nothing Else to Buy"*
  - Listing says: *"DESIGNED FOR KIDS AGES 8+"*
  - Image says: *"Beginner Embroidery Kit — No Experience Needed"*

- Show: Front of the Barbie-branded gift box at a slight angle so depth and quality are visible

- Barbie logo and branding must be clearly legible

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- High resolution (minimum 1600px longest side for zoom)
- No props, no lifestyle — pure product on white
- Box should look premium, gift-worthy
- Ensure Barbie licensing marks are visible but not distracting
- Consider showing the pink + light blue hoops resting against the box to add color and signal "embroidery kit" at thumbnail

### Image 2: What's Included — Complete Kit Contents

**Image Type:** Infographic / Flat-lay with callouts
**Customer Question:** "What comes in the box? Do I need to buy anything else?"

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | **"Complete Barbie Embroidery Kit — Nothing Else to Buy"** | Top center |
| Callout 1 | "8 Barbie Embroidery Designs" | Arrow pointing to fabric stack |
| Callout 2 | "2 Hoops — 6.3 Inch (Pink + Light Blue)" | Arrow pointing to hoops |
| Callout 3 | "Thread for All 8 Projects" | Arrow pointing to floss |
| Callout 4 | "10 Needles + 2 Threaders" | Arrow pointing to needles |
| Callout 5 | "Seam Ripper for Easy Fixes" | Arrow pointing to seam ripper |
| Callout 6 | "Step-by-Step Instructions" | Arrow pointing to instruction booklet |

**Why this copy:** "What's included?" is the #1 most-asked question in the category (~25% of all Q&A). "Nothing Else to Buy" directly eliminates purchase hesitation. Every callout uses descriptive product terms Rufus can index.

**Visual Elements:**
- Background: Light/clean (white or soft pink gradient to stay on-brand)
- Product position: All contents laid out flat in an organized grid
- Arrangement: Gift box on the left or behind; all components spread out in front
- Color coding: Pink/blue hoops should be prominently placed for visual appeal

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- Clean, organized flat-lay — nothing overlapping
- Each item clearly separated and labeled
- Callout lines should be thin, clean, Barbie-pink
- Text must be legible at mobile thumbnail size (test at 150x150px)
- Gift box should be visible in the composition to reinforce packaging quality

### Image 3: Barbie Designs — 8 Patterns Showcase

**Image Type:** Product showcase / Design gallery
**Customer Question:** "What do the designs look like? How many projects can she do?"

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | **"8 Barbie-Themed Embroidery Designs Included"** | Top center |
| Subline | "Officially Licensed Barbie Patterns" | Below headline |
| Badge | "Waterproof Fabric — Wipe Clean and Start Over" | Bottom center or corner badge |

**Why this copy:** Showcasing all 8 designs answers the value question ("How many projects?") and the design question ("Are they cute?"). "Officially Licensed" adds legitimacy. "Waterproof Fabric" is a unique differentiator NO competitor mentions — it directly addresses the concern about mistakes being permanent.

**Visual Elements:**
- Background: White or very light pink
- Product position: All 8 embroidery designs displayed in a grid (2 rows of 4, or a fan/cascade)
- Each design should be clearly visible — not overlapping
- Barbie branding visible on the fabric patterns

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- Photograph each design individually on white, then composite into grid
- Designs should be bright, colorful, and clearly Barbie-themed
- Include a small "waterproof" icon near the badge text
- This is the image that sells the Barbie brand advantage — make the designs look appealing
- Consider numbering each design (Design 1-8) for added organization feel

### Image 4: Beginner-Friendly — How It Works

**Image Type:** Process/Infographic
**Customer Question:** "Is this too hard for my child? Does she need embroidery experience?"

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | **"Beginner Embroidery Kit — No Experience Needed"** | Top center |
| Step 1 | "1. Follow the Printed Pattern on the Fabric" | Left side, with visual |
| Step 2 | "2. Stitch Along the Illustrated Guidelines" | Center, with visual |
| Step 3 | "3. Display in the Included Barbie Hoop" | Right side, with visual |
| Supporting | "Kid-Friendly Needles for Ages 8+ · Illustrated Step-by-Step Instructions" | Bottom |

**Why this copy:** "Is this good for beginners?" and "What age is this for?" are the 2nd and 3rd most common customer questions. A simple 3-step visual process removes fear of difficulty. "Kid-Friendly Needles" addresses safety without dedicating a full image to it. "Ages 8+" is a key Rufus-indexable search qualifier.

**Visual Elements:**
- Background: White with light pink accents
- Layout: 3-panel step progression (left to right)
- Step 1: Close-up of printed pattern on fabric (showing how clear the guidelines are)
- Step 2: Hands stitching (ideally child-sized hands or overhead shot of a child working)
- Step 3: Finished piece displayed in the pink or blue hoop
- Arrow or flow connecting the 3 steps

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- Keep it simple — 3 steps only
- Hands should be age-appropriate (8-12 year old) if using lifestyle
- If no lifestyle shoot possible, use close-up product shots for each step
- Instructions booklet can be subtly visible in Step 1 panel
- Steps must read clearly at thumbnail — bold numbers, minimal text

### Image 5: The Result — Finished Embroidery Art

**Image Type:** Lifestyle / Result showcase
**Customer Question:** "What does the finished project actually look like?"

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | **"Finished Embroidery Art — Made Entirely by Your Child"** | Top or bottom, avoiding center |
| Callout 1 | "Display in the Included 6.3 Inch Hoops" | Near the hoop |
| Callout 2 | "Pink and Light Blue Hoops Match Barbie Colors" | Near the hoop |

**Why this copy:** Gift buyers need to see the end result. "Made Entirely by Your Child" triggers the emotional response — pride, accomplishment, independence. It shifts the buyer from "is this worth it?" to "my child would be so proud." Mentioning hoop colors (pink + light blue) reinforces the Barbie aesthetic and tells buyers the result is display-worthy.

**Visual Elements:**
- Background: Lifestyle setting — child's bedroom, craft table, or hung on a wall
- Product position: 1-2 completed embroidery pieces displayed in the pink and light blue hoops
- Show the finished pieces looking polished and display-worthy
- Consider a child holding up a completed piece (pride/accomplishment shot)

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- This is the emotional image — warm lighting, inviting setting
- The finished piece should look achievable (not intimidatingly perfect)
- If using a model, 8-10 year old girl with proud expression
- Hoops displayed on a shelf or wall add "room decor" appeal
- Keep text minimal — let the visual tell the story

### Image 6: Gift Suitability — Gift-Ready Packaging

**Image Type:** Gift/lifestyle
**Customer Question:** "Is this appropriate as a gift? Does it look good to give?"

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | **"Gift-Ready Barbie Packaging — Arrives Ready to Wrap"** | Top center |
| Callout 1 | "Embroidery Kit for Girls Ages 8+" | Left or badge |
| Callout 2 | "Birthday · Christmas · Holiday" | Center list |
| Callout 3 | "Screen-Free Craft Activity" | Right or badge |
| Callout 4 | "Complete Kit — Nothing Else to Buy" | Bottom center |

**Why this copy:** ~15% of Q&A is about gift suitability. Gift buyers (grandparents, aunts, friends' parents) need to know: 1) It looks good to give, 2) It's age-appropriate, 3) It's a complete gift (no add-ons needed). Listing the occasions directly answers "when would I give this?" The Barbie gift box is a major advantage — lean into it.

**Visual Elements:**
- Background: Lifestyle — gift-giving context (birthday wrapping paper, holiday setting, or clean gift display)
- Product position: Gift box prominently displayed, possibly with a ribbon or bow nearby
- Optionally: A child receiving/opening the box (excitement shot)
- Barbie branding on box should be clearly visible

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- This image sells to the BUYER, not the user (grandparent/parent buying for a child)
- Gift box should look premium and substantial
- Seasonal versatility — avoid overly specific holiday decor (keep it general)
- Consider a split composition: left side = wrapped gift, right side = opened box with contents
- Occasion list should be clean and scannable

### Image 7: Activity Benefits — Screen-Free Skills

**Image Type:** Infographic / Educational
**Customer Question:** "Is this educational? What skills does my child develop?"

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | **"Screen-Free Craft Kit That Builds Real Skills"** | Top center |
| Benefit 1 | "Develops Fine Motor Skills and Hand-Eye Coordination" | Icon + text block |
| Benefit 2 | "Builds Focus, Patience, and Attention to Detail" | Icon + text block |
| Benefit 3 | "Encourages Creative Expression and Artistic Confidence" | Icon + text block |
| Benefit 4 | "Hours of Independent Play — Ages 8 and Up" | Icon + text block |

**Why this copy:** Parents and grandparents want to feel good about the purchase — not just fun, but developmental. "Screen-Free" is a key emotional trigger in the category. Each benefit is factual and specific (not "Fun for Kids!" which says nothing). "Independent Play" tells the buyer: she can do this on her own — you don't need to sit with her the whole time.

**Visual Elements:**
- Background: Clean, light — white or soft gradient
- Layout: 4 benefit blocks arranged in a grid or vertical list
- Each benefit paired with a simple icon (hands for motor skills, clock for focus, palette for creativity, play icon for independent play)
- Optionally: A small lifestyle image of a child focused on embroidery in the center

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- This is the "justify the purchase" image — for the analytical buyer
- Icons should be simple, on-brand (Barbie pink accents)
- Text must be readable at thumbnail — bold headlines, minimal body text
- Consider a subtle Barbie color scheme (pink, light blue, white)
- Not the most visually exciting image, but it closes the sale for hesitant gift-buyers

## Gaps We're Exploiting

| Gap | How We Exploit It |
|-----|-------------------|
| **No competitor has Barbie licensing** | Images 3 and 6 lead with Barbie branding — instant recognition and trust. The Barbie box alone makes our gift image stronger than any competitor's |
| **No competitor highlights waterproof/wipe-clean fabric** | Image 3 badge: "Waterproof Fabric — Wipe Clean and Start Over." This directly addresses beginner fear of mistakes |
| **CraftLab doesn't show a process/how-to** | Image 4 shows a clear 3-step process — reduces purchase friction for "is this too hard?" concerns |
| **Competitors don't emphasize dual hoop colors** | Image 5 specifically calls out "Pink and Light Blue Hoops Match Barbie Colors" — turns a basic component into a brand feature |
| **No competitor quantifies educational benefits** | Image 7 lists 4 specific developmental skills — gives analytical buyers data to justify purchase |
| **CraftLab uses 2 images for box (front + back)** | We use 1 hero only, freeing an extra slot for more informative content |
