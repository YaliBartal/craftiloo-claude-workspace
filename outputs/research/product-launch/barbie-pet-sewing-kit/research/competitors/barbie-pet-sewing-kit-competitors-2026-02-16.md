# Competitor Research: Barbie Pet Sewing Kit (Kids Sewing Kit Niche)

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Product:** BB08 — Barbie Pet Sewing Kit
**Niche:** Kids Sewing Kit (Felt)

## CRITICAL FINDING: No Barbie Kids Sewing Kit Exists on Amazon

The intersection of "Barbie" + "kids sewing/felt craft kit" is **completely empty**. Zero competing products. This is wide-open white space.

Existing Barbie craft products are all non-sewing: toy sewing machines ($40+), fashion design playsets, coloring sets, bead kits, jewelry kits. None are actual felt sewing kits.
