### Image Narrative Arc

The 7 images tell a gift-buyer's decision story: First they see the product (hero), then understand what they're getting (contents), confirm it's easy and mess-free (their #1 concern), see how simple the process is (3 steps), visualize the finished result displayed on a wall (emotional payoff), learn the developmental benefits (justification for purchase), and finally see the beautiful Barbie packaging (gift confidence). The arc moves from "What is this?" to "I'm buying this."

- **Words customers use:** "gem stickers", "sparkly", "thick cards", "mess-free", "display", "gift", "keeps busy", "screen-free", "easy to follow"

## Image-by-Image Detail

### Image 1: Hero Shot

**Image Type:** Main/Hero — Product on white background
**Customer Question:** "What does this product look like?"

#### Recommended Copy
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| *(none)* | *(Amazon requires clean hero image — no text, no graphics, no badges)* | — |

**Why no copy:** Amazon Terms of Service. Hero image must be the product on pure white background with no overlays.

#### Customer Insight Driving This Image
- First impression determines click-through rate
- Barbie pink packaging must be instantly recognizable at thumbnail size
- Showing 1-2 completed cards next to the box signals "craft kit with beautiful results"

#### Visual Approach Options

**Approach 1: Box + Completed Cards (Recommended)**
- Box angled ~15° with 2-3 completed gem art cards fanned in front
- Pros: Shows both product and result, highest information density
- Cons: More complex shot setup

**Approach 2: Box Only — Clean**
- Just the Barbie-branded box, front-facing
- Pros: Clean, professional, Barbie branding dominates
- Cons: Doesn't show what the craft looks like — lower CTR

**Approach 3: Box Open — Contents Spilling**
- Box slightly open with cards, gem stickers, and ribbons artfully arranged
- Pros: Creates curiosity, shows craft variety
- Cons: Can look cluttered at thumbnail size

#### Recommended Visual Direction
- Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF)
- Product position: Barbie color box angled ~15° to show front and side depth
- 2-3 completed gem art stitch cards placed in front of box, fanned to show different Barbie designs
- Box should dominate ~70% of frame, completed cards ~30%
- Barbie logo and branding on box must be clearly visible and legible at thumbnail size
- Gem stickers on completed cards should catch light / show sparkle

#### Photography/Design Brief
- Shoot from slight above angle (~20°) to show box depth and card detail
- Lighting: Bright, even studio lights — standard Amazon product photography. Add slight directional light to make gems sparkle
- Completed cards should show colorful gem variety (round, heart, rectangle shapes) and at least one visible satin ribbon
- The Barbie pink must be vibrant and true to brand — this is what makes the thumbnail stand out
- Resolution: Minimum 2000x2000px for zoom functionality
- Test thumbnail at 150px — Barbie logo must be readable

### Image 2: What's Included

**Image Type:** Infographic — Flat lay with labeled callouts
**Customer Question:** "What's included in the box? Does it come with everything I need?"

#### Recommended Copy
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Complete Barbie Gem Art Kit — 8 Card Designs" | Top center |
| Callout 1 | "8 Barbie Stitch Cards" | Arrow pointing to cards |
| Callout 2 | "Gem Stickers in 3 Shapes — Round · Heart · Rectangle" | Arrow pointing to gem sticker sheets |
| Callout 3 | "5 Satin Ribbon Colors" | Arrow pointing to ribbons |
| Callout 4 | "Display Hanger with Mounting Sticker" | Arrow pointing to hanger |
| Callout 5 | "Step-by-Step Instructions" | Arrow pointing to instruction sheet |
| Badge | "Everything Included — No Extra Supplies Needed" | Bottom center |

**Why this copy:** "What's included" is the #1 question across all craft kit Q&A sections (~25%). The word "Complete" directly answers "Do I need to buy anything else?" Calling out gem shapes (round, heart, rectangle) differentiates from EZCRA which doesn't emphasize shape variety.

#### Alternative Copy Options

**Option A — Keyword/SEO Focus:**
- Headline: "Barbie Gem Art Kit for Kids — All-In-One Craft Set"
- Supporting: "8 Gem Sticker Cards · 3 Gem Shapes · 5 Satin Ribbons · Display Hanger · Instructions"
- *Why: Front-loads "Barbie Gem Art Kit for Kids" for Rufus indexing. Uses "All-In-One Craft Set" which matches high-volume search term pattern.*

**Option B — Emotional/Gift-Buyer Focus:**
- Headline: "Open the Box and Start Creating — Everything She Needs Inside"
- Supporting: "8 Barbie Cards" · "Sparkling Gems" · "Colorful Ribbons" · "Display Hanger" · "Instructions"
- *Why: Speaks to gift-buyer confidence — "everything she needs" removes purchase anxiety. "Open and start" signals no prep needed.*

**Option C — Practical/Informational Focus:**
- Headline: "What's Inside the Barbie Gem Art Kit"
- Supporting: "8 Card Designs" · "Gem Stickers (Round, Heart, Rectangle)" · "5 Satin Ribbon Colors" · "Wall Hanger + Mount" · "Illustrated Guide"
- *Why: Direct answer to the #1 Q&A question. No fluff, just information. Appeals to detail-oriented buyers.*

**Option D — Differentiation Focus:**
- Headline: "More Than Just Stickers — Gems + Satin Ribbons + Display Hanger"
- Supporting: "3 Gem Shapes" · "5 Ribbon Colors" · "Wall Display" · "No Other Kit Includes Ribbons"
- *Why: Highlights what EZCRA doesn't have — satin ribbons and shape variety. Positions BB07 as the premium/more-complete option.*

#### Customer Insight Driving This Image
- "What's included?" is ~25% of all customer questions for this product type
- EZCRA leads with "990+ stickers" — a compelling number. We counter with shape variety + ribbons
- Gift buyers need to see everything laid out to feel confident about value

#### Visual Approach Options

**Approach 1: Organized Flat Lay (Recommended)**
- All contents laid out neatly on white/light pink background
- Pros: Maximum clarity, easy to scan each item
- Cons: Can look clinical

**Approach 2: "Unboxing" — Contents emerging from box**
- Box open with contents arranged as if just unboxed
- Pros: More natural, shows the opening experience
- Cons: Box blocks some items

#### Recommended Visual Direction
- Background: White with subtle Barbie-pink accent border or gradient edge
- All kit contents laid out in organized flat lay
- Cards fanned to show different Barbie designs (all 8 partially visible)
- Gem sticker sheets arranged to show the 3 shapes clearly
- Satin ribbons in 5 colors spread to show color variety (rainbow arrangement)
- Hanger placed at bottom showing full display accessory
- Callout style: Clean lines, legible font, Barbie-pink accent color

#### Photography/Design Brief
- Shoot directly overhead (90° top-down flat lay)
- Arrange items by type — cards as main group, gems next, ribbons fanned below, hanger and instructions at edges
- Ribbons should be unfurled/draped to show texture (not bundled)
- Gem sticker sheets should be positioned so all 3 shapes are visible and identifiable
- All text must be readable at mobile thumbnail size — test at 150px width
- Font: Clean sans-serif, minimum 18pt equivalent at full size

#### Competitor Comparison (This Position)
- **EZCRA:** Shows flat lay of contents with "990+ Stickers" prominent
- **Our approach:** Emphasize shape variety and ribbon colors instead of raw sticker count — more perceived craft variety

### Image 3: Mess-Free & Easy

**Image Type:** Infographic with lifestyle element — Feature highlights
**Customer Question:** "Is it messy? Do I need to help? Is it really easy?"

#### Recommended Copy
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Mess-Free Gem Art — No Glue, No Paint, No Cleanup" | Top center |
| Feature 1 | "Peel-and-Stick Gems — Just Place on Card" | Left section with close-up of gem being placed |
| Feature 2 | "Easy Ribbon Tying — Adds Color and Texture" | Center section with ribbon detail |
| Feature 3 | "Ages 5-10 — Beginners to Experienced" | Right section |
| Badge | "No Scissors · No Glue · No Paint" | Bottom center strip |

**Why this copy:** "Mess-free" is the #1 praise theme in competitor reviews. Parents are desperate for craft activities that don't create chaos. "No glue, no paint, no cleanup" uses customer vocabulary directly from reviews. Explicitly naming what's NOT needed (scissors, glue, paint) removes purchase barriers.

#### Alternative Copy Options

**Option A — Keyword/SEO Focus:**
- Headline: "Gem Art Craft Kit for Kids — Peel and Stick, Mess-Free"
- Supporting: "No Glue Needed" · "No Paint Required" · "No Scissors" · "Ages 5-10"
- *Why: Leads with "Gem Art Craft Kit for Kids" — indexable niche term. "Peel and Stick" is a searchable feature.*

**Option B — Emotional/Gift-Buyer Focus:**
- Headline: "Crafting Without the Cleanup — Finally"
- Supporting: "Peel-and-Stick Gems" · "No Glue, No Paint, No Mess" · "Kids Craft Independently"
- *Why: Speaks directly to the parent's relief. "Finally" validates their frustration with messy craft kits. Gift buyers love knowing this won't create problems.*

**Option C — Practical/Informational Focus:**
- Headline: "How It Works — Peel, Place, Done"
- Supporting: "Self-Adhesive Gems Stick Instantly" · "Satin Ribbons Tie On" · "No Additional Supplies" · "Safe for Ages 5+"
- *Why: Answers the mechanics question directly. Buyers who want to understand exactly how the product works before purchasing.*

#### Customer Insight Driving This Image
- "Mess-free" is mentioned in 40%+ of positive reviews for gem art kits
- Parents explicitly praise "no glue required" as a key purchase driver
- EZCRA reviews confirm this: kids can "craft anywhere — kitchen table, bedroom floor"
- If we DON'T address mess concern, parents assume it's messy (default assumption for kids crafts)

#### Recommended Visual Direction
- Background: White with Barbie-pink section panels
- Three-column layout showing the "no mess" proof
- Left: Close-up of a gem sticker being peeled from sheet and placed on card
- Center: Satin ribbon being tied through a card hole
- Right: Child's clean hands / clean table after crafting (no mess visible)
- Bottom strip with the "No Scissors · No Glue · No Paint" badges

#### Photography/Design Brief
- Close-up shots for each feature — must see the peel-and-stick action clearly
- Child's hands (~8 year old girl) performing the actions
- Clean, bright workspace — emphasize tidiness
- Lighting: Bright, warm, natural light feel
- The "after" tidiness shot is the money shot — clean table, completed card, zero mess

#### Competitor Comparison (This Position)
- **EZCRA:** Mentions mess-free in bullets but doesn't have a dedicated image for it
- **Our approach:** Entire image dedicated to proving mess-free — visual proof is stronger than text claims

### Image 4: How It Works (3-Step Process)

**Image Type:** Step-by-step infographic
**Customer Question:** "How does it work? Will my kid get frustrated? Do I need to help?"

#### Recommended Copy
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "3 Simple Steps to Barbie Wall Art" | Top center |
| Step 1 label | "Step 1: Peel Gem Stickers from Sheet" | Above step 1 photo |
| Step 1 note | "Choose from 3 shapes — round, heart, rectangle" | Below step 1 photo |
| Step 2 label | "Step 2: Place Gems on Barbie Card Design" | Above step 2 photo |
| Step 2 note | "Follow the design — each gem has its spot" | Below step 2 photo |
| Step 3 label | "Step 3: Add Ribbons and Hang on Wall" | Above step 3 photo |
| Step 3 note | "Display-ready — hanger included" | Below step 3 photo |

**Why this copy:** Instruction clarity is a top customer concern (~15%). The 3-step visual answers "how does it work?" before they read the bullets. "3 Simple Steps" borrows proven structure from EZCRA's approach. Adding ribbons in Step 3 shows our product has MORE steps (more craft value) but keeps it simple.

#### Alternative Copy Options

**Option A — Keyword/SEO Focus:**
- Headline: "Barbie Gem Art Kit — Easy 3-Step Process"
- Steps: "Peel Gem Stickers" · "Place on Stitch Card" · "Tie Ribbons and Display"
- *Why: Puts "Barbie Gem Art Kit" in the headline for Rufus. Uses product-specific terms.*

**Option B — Emotional/Gift-Buyer Focus:**
- Headline: "So Easy She Can Do It Herself"
- Steps: "Peel the Sparkly Gems" · "Create Barbie Artwork" · "Hang Her Masterpiece"
- *Why: Addresses the parent's #1 concern — "Will I need to do this for her?" Uses emotional outcome language.*

**Option C — Practical/Informational Focus:**
- Headline: "How to Create Barbie Gem Art — Step by Step"
- Steps: "Step 1: Select and Peel Self-Adhesive Gems" · "Step 2: Match Gems to Card Design Pattern" · "Step 3: Tie Satin Ribbons and Mount with Included Hanger"
- *Why: Maximum detail for detail-oriented buyers. Shows the full process with no ambiguity.*

#### Customer Insight Driving This Image
- "Easy to follow" appears in 30%+ of positive reviews
- EZCRA's negative reviews cite younger kids struggling — our 3-step visual reassures
- Showing the ribbon step differentiates from EZCRA (they have no ribbon element)

#### Recommended Visual Direction
- Background: White with subtle numbered circles (1, 2, 3) in Barbie pink
- Three side-by-side process photos showing child's hands performing each step
- Step 1: Fingers peeling a sparkly gem sticker from the sheet
- Step 2: Placing a gem onto a Barbie card design — showing the pattern guiding placement
- Step 3: Tying a satin ribbon + holding finished card next to wall hanger
- Arrow flow between steps (left → right)

#### Photography/Design Brief
- Use a real child model (girl ~8 years old) with hands clearly visible
- Step 1 should show the satisfying peel moment — sticker separating from sheet
- Step 2 should show the card design with some gems already placed (progress visible)
- Step 3 should show the completed card with ribbons AND the wall hanger — the finish line
- Warm, natural lighting — not clinical
- Each step photo should be independently readable at mobile scroll size

#### Competitor Comparison (This Position)
- **EZCRA:** Likely uses a process image but without ribbon element
- **Our approach:** 3-step includes the ribbon step — shows more craft value in same simple format

### Image 5: Finished Result / Display

**Image Type:** Lifestyle — Completed gem art displayed in real context
**Customer Question:** "What does the finished product look like? Can they display it?"

#### Recommended Copy
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Display-Ready Barbie Gem Art for Their Bedroom" | Top center |
| Callout 1 | "Wall Hanger Included" | Near the hanging card |
| Callout 2 | "Thick, Sturdy Card Stock" | Near card edge/texture |
| Callout 3 | "8 Designs to Collect and Display" | Bottom center |

**Why this copy:** Competitor reviews show kids love displaying finished work. "Display-ready" is a key purchase driver for parents who don't want craft projects that go in the trash. Mentioning "thick, sturdy card stock" directly addresses EZCRA's praise point ("more like cardboard, much thicker than paper") — we match this quality. "8 designs to collect" reframes the cards as a collection.

#### Alternative Copy Options

**Option A — Keyword/SEO Focus:**
- Headline: "Barbie Gem Art — Finished Cards Ready to Display"
- Supporting: "Wall Hanger Included" · "8 Collectible Barbie Designs" · "Thick Card Stock"
- *Why: "Barbie Gem Art" in headline for Rufus. "Finished Cards Ready to Display" answers the result question with keywords.*

**Option B — Emotional/Gift-Buyer Focus:**
- Headline: "Watch Them Beam When They Hang Their Barbie Art"
- Supporting: "Wall Hanger Included" · "A Creation They're Proud Of" · "Bedroom Decor They Made Themselves"
- *Why: Speaks to the emotional payoff — parent/grandparent witnessing the child's pride. This is what sells gift buyers.*

**Option C — Practical/Informational Focus:**
- Headline: "What the Finished Barbie Gem Art Cards Look Like"
- Supporting: "Sturdy Card Stock" · "Gems Stick Permanently" · "Hanger Mounts with Included Sticker" · "No Frame Needed"
- *Why: Shows the finished product with practical details. Answers "will the gems fall off?" concern preemptively.*

#### Customer Insight Driving This Image
- "Can display their finished art" — recurring theme in positive reviews
- Parents value crafts that produce something lasting, not disposable
- EZCRA includes easel + hanger — display is a proven selling point in this niche
- Kids' pride in showing their work is a key emotional trigger for gift buyers

#### Recommended Visual Direction
- Background: Real child's bedroom — wall with the finished card hanging via the included hanger
- 2-3 completed Barbie gem art cards visible — one hanging on wall, 1-2 propped on a shelf nearby
- Cards should show sparkling gems catching light and visible satin ribbon details
- Optional: Girl (~8 years old) admiring her creation on the wall (pride moment)
- Warm, cozy bedroom lighting — aspirational but relatable

#### Photography/Design Brief
- Lifestyle setting — real bedroom, not a studio mockup
- Cards on wall should be the focal point — show how they look as room decor
- Gems should sparkle/reflect light to emphasize the "gem art" premium feel
- Show at least 2 different Barbie designs to communicate variety
- Multiple display options visible: wall-mounted (hanger) + propped on shelf
- The "pride moment" — if using a child model, capture her looking at/pointing to her displayed work

#### Competitor Comparison (This Position)
- **EZCRA:** Shows finished art with easel display on a desk
- **Our approach:** Shows wall-mounted display in a real bedroom — more aspirational, shows how it becomes room decor. Emphasizes "8 designs to collect" which EZCRA doesn't frame.

### Image 6: Skills & Screen-Free

**Image Type:** Infographic — Benefits with supporting lifestyle element
**Customer Question:** "What skills does this teach? How long does each card take? What age range?"

#### Recommended Copy
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Screen-Free Activity That Builds Fine Motor Skills" | Top center |
| Benefit 1 | "Hand-Eye Coordination" | Left icon/badge |
| Benefit 2 | "Focus & Patience" | Center icon/badge |
| Benefit 3 | "Artistic Confidence" | Right icon/badge |
| Time note | "20-45 Minutes Per Card · 8 Cards = Hours of Creative Time" | Middle strip |
| Age note | "Ages 5-10" | Bottom badge |

**Why this copy:** "Screen-free" is a dominant purchase motivator — parents and especially grandparents actively search for non-screen activities. Review language confirms: "keeps my child from being on electronics." The developmental benefits (fine motor, focus, patience) provide gift-buyer justification. Time estimate (20-45 min per card) answers "how long will this last?" without overpromising.

#### Alternative Copy Options

**Option A — Keyword/SEO Focus:**
- Headline: "Gem Art Kit for Kids — Develops Fine Motor Skills, Ages 5-10"
- Supporting: "Hand-Eye Coordination" · "Focus & Concentration" · "20-45 Min Per Card" · "Screen-Free Craft Activity"
- *Why: Leads with "Gem Art Kit for Kids" + "Fine Motor Skills" — both Rufus-indexable. Age range in headline for search matching.*

**Option B — Emotional/Gift-Buyer Focus:**
- Headline: "The Gift That Gets Them Off Screens"
- Supporting: "Hours of Engaged Creative Time" · "Builds Focus and Patience" · "8 Barbie Cards = Multiple Sessions"
- *Why: Directly addresses the grandparent/parent pain point. "Gets them off screens" uses their exact vocabulary. Emotional validation of the purchase.*

**Option C — Practical/Informational Focus:**
- Headline: "8 Cards, 20-45 Minutes Each — Hours of Screen-Free Crafting"
- Supporting: "Fine Motor Skill Development" · "Hand-Eye Coordination" · "Ages 5-10" · "Independent or Guided"
- *Why: Leads with the math — 8 cards x 20-45 min = concrete time value. Practical buyers want to know exactly what they're getting.*

#### Customer Insight Driving This Image
- "Screen-free" and "away from electronics" appear in 20%+ of reviews
- Time estimates help parents plan — "how long will this keep them busy?"
- Fine motor skills mentioned by parents who value educational gifts
- If we DON'T address duration, parents worry it's a 10-minute activity

#### Recommended Visual Direction
- Background: Split design — left half: infographic with skill icons/badges on white, right half: lifestyle photo of child focused on gem placement
- Skill icons: Simple, clean icons (hand icon for motor skills, eye icon for coordination, brain icon for focus)
- Time indicator: Visual timeline or clock graphic showing 20-45 min range
- Lifestyle element: Child deeply focused on placing gems — shows engagement in action

#### Photography/Design Brief
- The lifestyle photo should capture genuine concentration — child looking down at card, placing a gem carefully
- Avoid posed/stiff shots — natural engagement
- Warm lighting on the lifestyle half, clean design on the infographic half
- Icons should be in Barbie brand colors (pink, white, light blue)
- Text must be legible at mobile size — test at 150px width

#### Competitor Comparison (This Position)
- **EZCRA:** May mention developmental benefits but doesn't dedicate a full image to it
- **Our approach:** Full image for skills + screen-free — validates the purchase for gift-buying grandparents

### Image 7: Gift-Ready

**Image Type:** Gift/packaging lifestyle
**Customer Question:** "Is this a good gift? Does it come in nice packaging?"

#### Recommended Copy
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Gift-Ready Barbie Box — No Wrapping Needed" | Top center |
| Callout 1 | "Officially Licensed Barbie" | Badge near Barbie logo |
| Callout 2 | "Beautiful Color Gift Box" | Arrow to box |
| Occasion list | "Birthday · Christmas · Easter · Any Occasion" | Bottom strip |

**Why this copy:** Gift buyers are the dominant purchaser segment (grandparents and parents). The #1 gift-buyer concern: "Is the packaging nice enough to give?" "No Wrapping Needed" removes a practical barrier. "Officially Licensed Barbie" provides brand trust for the gift. The occasion list (birthday, Christmas, Easter) captures seasonal search behavior and plants seeds for multiple purchase occasions.

#### Alternative Copy Options

**Option A — Keyword/SEO Focus:**
- Headline: "Barbie Arts and Crafts Gift for Girls Ages 5-10"
- Supporting: "Licensed Barbie Gift Box" · "Birthday · Christmas · Easter" · "No Wrapping Needed"
- *Why: "Barbie Arts and Crafts Gift for Girls Ages 5-10" is a high-value Rufus-indexable string covering multiple search patterns.*

**Option B — Emotional/Gift-Buyer Focus:**
- Headline: "The Gift She'll Run to Open First"
- Supporting: "Barbie-Branded Box" · "No Wrapping Needed — Already Gift-Ready" · "Hours of Creative Fun Inside"
- *Why: Plays on the gift-giving fantasy — the child's excitement at seeing a Barbie craft box. Grandparents buy the emotion, not the product.*

**Option C — Practical/Informational Focus:**
- Headline: "Arrives in Gift-Ready Barbie Packaging"
- Supporting: "Officially Licensed" · "Sturdy Color Box" · "No Additional Wrapping Required" · "Ships in Amazon Box for Surprise Gifts"
- *Why: Answers all packaging logistics. "Ships in Amazon box" is a real concern for gift buyers who ship directly to the recipient.*

#### Customer Insight Driving This Image
- "Bought as a gift" appears in 40%+ of reviews for this product category
- "Nice packaging" and "looked great under the tree" are exact customer phrases
- Barbie branding on the box IS the gift — the child sees Barbie and is immediately excited
- Gift buyers need confidence the product looks premium without extra effort

#### Recommended Visual Direction
- Background: Gift-giving context — under a Christmas tree, on a birthday gift table, or being handed to a child
- Barbie box prominently displayed, possibly with a subtle bow/ribbon around it (props, not product)
- Alternative: The unboxing moment — child's hands opening the Barbie box with excitement visible
- Barbie logo and branding must be the dominant visual

#### Photography/Design Brief
- Two options:
  1. **Gift table shot:** Box on wrapped gift table or near birthday decorations — signals "gift-ready"
  2. **Unboxing shot:** Child opening the box — captures excitement
- Barbie pink should dominate the image's color palette
- If showing gift context, keep it simple — don't overcrowd with other gifts
- The box itself IS the star — make it look premium and desirable
- Occasion list at bottom should use subtle icon + text treatment (cake for birthday, tree for Christmas, egg for Easter)

#### Competitor Comparison (This Position)
- **EZCRA:** Generic craft kit packaging — no licensed IP appeal
- **Our approach:** Barbie-branded box is inherently more gift-worthy than any generic packaging. The IP does the heavy lifting here.

| EZCRA | B0CWLTTZ2G | 7+ | Professional product shots, "990+ stickers" callout, display shown | No licensed IP, generic themes, no ribbon element shown | Keyword-rich text overlays, sticker count prominent |

#### Position-by-Position Competitor Comparison
| Position | EZCRA | Our Approach | Why Different |
|----------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | Box + completed art on white | Box + completed cards on white | Similar approach — standard hero. Our Barbie branding is the differentiator |
| 2 | Flat lay of all contents | Flat lay of all contents | We emphasize gem SHAPES and ribbon COLORS vs their sticker COUNT |
| 3 | Likely features/benefits | Mess-free focus | We dedicate an image to mess-free — their biggest praise point turned into visual proof |
| 4 | Process steps | 3-step process | We add the ribbon step — shows more craft value |
| 5 | Finished art display | Bedroom wall display (lifestyle) | We show real-room context vs desk display — more aspirational |
| 6 | Benefits/features | Skills + screen-free | We make this educational/developmental — gift-buyer justification |
| 7 | Gift/packaging | Barbie gift box | Our Barbie IP packaging is inherently stronger than their generic box |

### Gaps We're Exploiting

1. **No licensed IP in gem art niche** — Barbie creates instant recognition and gift confidence
2. **No ribbon craft element** — EZCRA is gems only. We add satin ribbons = more craft variety, more perceived value
3. **Age overpromise gap** — EZCRA claims 3-8 but gets complaints about youngest kids. We claim 5-10 honestly
4. **No dedicated mess-free image** — Competitors mention it in text but don't prove it visually
5. **Display as room decor** — Competitors show desk display; we show bedroom wall decor (more aspirational)
6. **Gift-buyer closing image** — Barbie box is inherently more gift-worthy than any generic packaging
