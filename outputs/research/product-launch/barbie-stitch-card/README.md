## Strategic Summary

- **Niche:** Gem Art Kits — new, underdeveloped. EZCRA is only real competitor
- **Key advantage:** Barbie IP (no licensed gem art kits exist)
- **Secondary advantage:** Satin ribbons add craft variety competitors lack
- **Target age:** 5-10 (honest, avoiding EZCRA's 3-8 overpromise)
- **Primary keywords:** gem art kit for kids, Barbie, diamond art for kids
