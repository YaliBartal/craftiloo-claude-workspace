## Strategic Insight

The gem art niche has low search volume per term, but EZCRA's 2K+/month sales prove demand exists. Strategy:

1. **Own the "Barbie + craft" search space** — no competitor can touch this
2. **Capture all gem art terms** — we're a perfect match
3. **Borrow diamond art volume** — EZCRA does this too (puts "diamond art" in title even though it's not diamond painting)
4. **Gift-buyer terms** — grandparents search "arts and crafts for kids" and "gifts for girls"
5. **Let Barbie do the heavy lifting** — the IP alone drives discovery via brand search, browse, and recommendation algorithms
