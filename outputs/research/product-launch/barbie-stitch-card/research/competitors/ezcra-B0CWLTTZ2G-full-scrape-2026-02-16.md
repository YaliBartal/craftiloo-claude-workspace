### Brand Story
**Headline:** "Started by Parents, for You"
**Story:** "EZCRA was born from a simple frustration: why were craft kits either too messy or complicated? We created what we wished existed all along -- craft kits that respect both children's capabilities and parents' sanity. Today, over 20,000 families have chosen EZCRA to nurture creativity in their homes. Every kit we design starts with this question: 'Would I give this to my own child?' If the answer isn't an enthusiastic yes, it doesn't leave our studio."
**Tagline:** "EZCRA, We Make It Easy"
**Brand mission:** "We believe every child deserves to feel the pride of creating something with their own hands -- without the mess and frustration."

## 2. CUSTOMER REVIEWS (30 scraped, sorted by helpfulness)

### Review #1 — 5 stars | "Great activity for kids" (5 helpful)
> "This kit is a lot of fun for kids. Kept my four year old busy for hours and she loved it! Great product quality, the gems stick well and are super easy to take off if the kid sticks them to the table, walls or any other surfaces. The stickers come in 3 different sizes (small, medium and large) and in several different shapes like hearts, circles, ovals etc. There are more than enough stickers for these 6 projects which the child will want to use for something else. The final pictures come out very pretty even if done by a four year old :)"

### Review #5 — 4 stars | "Great fun, use your own tape to hang on wall" (1 helpful)
> "My 5 year old loves this. It's kept her very busy. The only reason I removed a star is because the sticky tape they provide for hanging the pieces up on the wall do not work at all. They don't stay up"
— Verified, Nov 21, 2025

### Review #6 — 5 stars | "Quality, amount of crafts in the kit" (3 helpful)
> "My 4-year-old granddaughter loves crafts and anything that sparkles. The quality of this product is excellent. Plenty of gems are included, the colors of the material are exactly as shown on the photos, a great value for the money. I get nervous with some boxed crafts because they can look good in the pictures, but arrive with very little contents. This is not the case with the kit. I thought my granddaughter would be ready for this craft, but it is just a bit advanced for her. I look forward to waiting until next summer when her motor skills have improved. She will love it!"

| 8 | **Sretoul Cartoon Diamond Art** | B0GJZDPWMY | 4-pack, wall decor, ages 4-6 |

**Key insight:** Most competitors are drill-based diamond painting kits (5D gems with stylus), NOT peel-and-stick gem sticker kits like EZCRA and BB07. EZCRA and BB07 are in a different, simpler sub-niche that's better for younger children (ages 3-8 vs 6-12 for diamond painting).
