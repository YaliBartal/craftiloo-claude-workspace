# Competitor Analysis: Barbie Stitch Card (BB07)

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Product:** BB07 — Barbie Stitch Card (Gem Art Kit)
**Search Terms:** "gem art kit for kids", "gem sticker kit for kids", "diamond art for kids"
**Competitors Analyzed:** 1 direct (EZCRA) + adjacent gem/diamond art products

---

## Key Finding

**EZCRA is the only real direct competitor in this niche.** The gem sticker card market is extremely underdeveloped — most "gem art" and "diamond art" search results return drill-based diamond painting kits, which are a completely different product. BB07 with Barbie IP enters a near-empty niche.
