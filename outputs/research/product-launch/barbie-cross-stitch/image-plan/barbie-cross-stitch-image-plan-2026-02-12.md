## Image-by-Image Detail

### Image 1: Hero Shot

**Image Type:** Main/Hero — Product on white background
**Customer Question:** "What does this product look like?"

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| *(none)* | *(Amazon requires clean hero image — no text, no graphics, no badges)* | — |

**Why no copy:** Amazon Terms of Service. Hero image must be the product on pure white background with no overlays.

**Visual Elements:**
- Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF)
- Product position: Barbie color box angled ~15° to show front and side
- 2-3 completed keychain projects placed in front of the box, fanned out to show different Barbie designs
- Box should dominate ~80% of the frame, keychains ~20%
- Barbie logo and branding on box must be clearly visible and legible at thumbnail size

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- Shoot from slight above angle (~20°) to show box depth and keychain detail
- Lighting: Bright, even, no harsh shadows — standard Amazon product photography
- Keychains should show the colorful clips (pink, blue, purple) to create visual pop
- The Barbie pink must be vibrant — this is what makes the thumbnail stand out in search results vs. all-generic-craft-kit competitors
- Resolution: Minimum 2000x2000px for zoom functionality

### Image 2: What's Included

**Image Type:** Infographic — Flat lay with labeled callouts
**Customer Question:** "What's included in the box? Does it come with everything I need?"

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Complete Cross Stitch Kit — 7 Barbie Designs" | Top center |
| Callout 1 | "7 Pre-Printed Fabrics" | Arrow pointing to fabrics |
| Callout 2 | "6-Color Embroidery Floss" | Arrow pointing to floss |
| Callout 3 | "4 Safe Plastic Needles" | Arrow pointing to needles |
| Callout 4 | "2 Needle Threaders" | Arrow pointing to threaders (HIGHLIGHT — unique feature) |
| Callout 5 | "7 Keychains (3 Pink · 2 Blue · 2 Purple)" | Arrow pointing to keychains |
| Callout 6 | "Bonus Barbie Sticker Page" | Arrow pointing to sticker sheet |
| Callout 7 | "Step-by-Step Instructions" | Arrow pointing to instruction sheet |

**Why this copy:** "What's included" is the #1 question across all competitor Q&A sections (~25% of all questions). The word "Complete" directly answers the worry "Do I need to buy anything else?" The threader callout gets extra visual emphasis because it's BB02's biggest competitive advantage — no competitor includes threaders, and threading is the #1 complaint.

**Visual Elements:**
- Background: Light pink or white with subtle Barbie-pink accent border
- All kit contents laid out neatly in organized flat lay
- Each item group visually separated
- Threader callout should be slightly larger or have a highlight badge (e.g., subtle "Only Kit with Threaders" note)

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- Shoot directly overhead (90° top-down flat lay)
- Arrange items by size — fabrics as base, smaller items around the perimeter
- Color code the keychains so all 3 pink are together, 2 blue together, 2 purple together
- Callout style: Clean lines, legible font, Barbie-pink accent color
- All text must be readable at mobile thumbnail size — test at 150px width

### Image 3: Beginner-Friendly & Safety

**Image Type:** Infographic — Feature highlights with close-up product shots
**Customer Question:** "Is this really for beginners? Are the needles safe for my child?"

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Beginner-Friendly — No Experience Needed" | Top center |
| Feature 1 | "Pre-Printed Patterns — No Counting Required" | Left section, with close-up of printed fabric |
| Feature 2 | "Blunt Plastic Needles — Safe for Kids" | Center section, with close-up of needle tip |
| Feature 3 | "Needle Threaders Included — No Struggling to Thread" | Right section, with close-up of threader in use |
| Badge | "Ages 6-12" | Bottom corner |

**Why this copy:** Age appropriateness and safety are the #2 and #6 customer concerns. The most-upvoted negative review across all competitors (8 helpful votes) specifically complains about threading difficulty. "No Experience Needed" comes directly from parent review language. "No Counting Required" addresses the cross-stitch-specific fear that patterns are confusing.

**Visual Elements:**
- Background: White with Barbie-pink section dividers
- Three-column layout, each column showing one feature with close-up product photo
- Pre-printed fabric close-up showing clear, visible pattern lines
- Needle tip close-up showing blunt, rounded end (not sharp)
- Threader in action — showing how easy it is to thread the needle

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- Close-up macro shots for each feature — viewers must see the blunt needle tip clearly
- The threader demonstration is the money shot — show it mid-action with thread being pulled through
- Fonts: Clean, modern sans-serif, minimum 24pt equivalent at full size
- Three-panel layout works best for mobile scrolling

### Image 4: How It Works (3-Step Process)

**Image Type:** Step-by-step infographic
**Customer Question:** "How does it work? Will my kid get frustrated? Do I need to help?"

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "3 Simple Steps to a Barbie Keychain" | Top center |
| Step 1 label | "Step 1: Thread Needle with Easy Threader" | Above step 1 photo |
| Step 1 note | "Even 6-year-olds can do it" | Below step 1 photo |
| Step 2 label | "Step 2: Follow the Pre-Printed Pattern" | Above step 2 photo |
| Step 2 note | "Just stitch where the lines are" | Below step 2 photo |
| Step 3 label | "Step 3: Snap into Keychain Clip" | Above step 3 photo |
| Step 3 note | "Done — wear it on your backpack" | Below step 3 photo |

**Why this copy:** Instruction quality is the #4 customer concern (~15%). The most-upvoted negative review across ALL competitors specifically asks for clearer instructions. Showing the 3-step process visually answers this before the customer even reads the bullets. "Even 6-year-olds can do it" uses the lower end of the age range to reassure hesitant buyers.

**Visual Elements:**
- Background: White with subtle numbered circles (1, 2, 3) in Barbie pink
- Three side-by-side process photos showing actual hands (child-sized) performing each step
- Step 1: Child's hands using the threader to thread the needle
- Step 2: Child's hands stitching on the pre-printed Barbie fabric, following the pattern
- Step 3: Completed design being snapped into a pink keychain clip
- Arrow flow between steps (left → right)

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- Use a real child model (girl ~8-10 years old) with hands clearly visible
- Hands should be at a natural angle, not posed stiffly
- Step 2 should show the pre-printed pattern clearly on the fabric — the lines guiding where to stitch
- Step 3 should show the "click" moment — satisfaction of completing the project
- Warm, natural lighting (not clinical)

### Image 5: Lifestyle / Finished Output

**Image Type:** Lifestyle — Completed keychains in real-world context
**Customer Question:** "What do the finished projects look like? What can kids do with them?"

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Wear Your Creations — 7 Keychains in 3 Colors" | Top center |
| Callout 1 | "Backpacks" | Near backpack keychain placement |
| Callout 2 | "Bags" | Near bag keychain placement |
| Callout 3 | "Zipper Pulls" | Near zipper keychain placement |
| Color note | "3 Pink · 2 Blue · 2 Purple" | Bottom center |

**Why this copy:** Competitors show completed projects but rarely show them being USED. Reviews mention "backpack charms" and "backpack decoration" as the main appeal. Showing keychains in real-world context (on an actual backpack, bag, zipper) helps parents visualize the value — these aren't things that sit on a shelf, they're accessories kids use daily. The color variety (3 pink, 2 blue, 2 purple) is unique to BB02.

**Visual Elements:**
- Background: Natural setting — school hallway or bedroom with a backpack
- 3-4 completed keychains attached to a pink/purple backpack, clearly visible
- 1-2 keychains on a pencil case or small bag
- All three keychain colors (pink, blue, purple) visible
- Optional: A girl (~8-10) wearing the backpack, keychains visible, walking or at desk

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- Lifestyle setting, not studio — relatable school/home context
- Natural lighting, warm tones
- Keychains should be in focus, background slightly blurred
- Show variety — different Barbie designs on different colored clips
- The backpack or bag should be a typical school backpack — not a prop

### Image 6: Skills & Screen-Free

**Image Type:** Infographic — Benefits with supporting lifestyle element
**Customer Question:** "What skills does this teach? How long does each project take? What age range?"

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Screen-Free Activity That Builds Real Skills" | Top center |
| Benefit 1 | "Hand-Eye Coordination" | Left column, with icon |
| Benefit 2 | "Fine Motor Skills" | Left column, with icon |
| Benefit 3 | "Focus & Patience" | Right column, with icon |
| Benefit 4 | "Creative Expression" | Right column, with icon |
| Time callout | "30-60 Minutes Per Project" | Center, highlighted |
| Age badge | "Ages 6-12" | Bottom corner |

**Why this copy:** "Screen-free activity" appears repeatedly in positive reviews and is a primary purchase driver for parents. The specific skill callouts (coordination, motor skills, focus, patience) match parent review language and are the exact benefits Rufus surfaces when customers ask "is this educational?" The time estimate (30-60 min per project) answers the time-to-complete question and helps parents plan activities.

**Visual Elements:**
- Background: Split — left half is a soft lifestyle photo of a girl stitching (engaged, focused), right half is clean infographic with benefit callouts
- Or: Full infographic with a central lifestyle photo surrounded by benefit callouts
- Icons: Simple, clean icons for each skill (eye for coordination, hand for motor skills, brain for focus, star for creative)
- Time callout in a distinct badge/bubble format

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- If using a lifestyle element, show a child deeply engaged in stitching — not looking at camera, genuinely focused
- The "screen-free" message works best when the child looks naturally absorbed, not posed
- Keep benefit text concise — each label is 2-3 words max
- Color palette: Barbie pink accents on white, matching the brand aesthetic

### Image 7: Gift-Ready

**Image Type:** Gift presentation — Box and unboxing moment
**Customer Question:** "Is this a good gift? Does it come in nice packaging? Do I need to wrap it?"

**Text on This Image:**
| Element | Exact Copy | Placement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Headline | "Gift-Ready Barbie Box — No Wrapping Needed" | Top center |
| Callout 1 | "Bonus Barbie Sticker Page Inside" | Near sticker page peek |
| Occasion tags | "Birthday · Christmas · Easter · Any Occasion" | Bottom, as tags/badges |

**Why this copy:** ~10% of all customer questions are about gift suitability. Gift buyers (grandparents, aunts, family friends) are the primary purchasers — they are NOT the end user. They need to know: (1) the packaging looks presentable as a gift, (2) they don't need to buy wrapping, and (3) the sticker page is a bonus surprise. "No Wrapping Needed" is a direct answer to a real convenience concern from gift buyers.

**Visual Elements:**
- Background: Gift-occasion setting — wrapped presents nearby, ribbon, or a table with birthday/holiday decor
- Barbie box prominently displayed, slightly open to peek at the sticker page inside
- The sticker page should be partially visible, showing Barbie designs
- Optional: A completed keychain next to the box showing what the recipient will create

**Photography/Design Notes:**
- Warm, inviting lighting — gift-giving atmosphere
- The box should look premium and gift-worthy — no plastic wrap or shipping damage visible
- Sticker page peek creates a "bonus surprise" feeling
- Occasion tags at the bottom help Rufus index this image for gift-related searches
- The box is the star of this image — it should fill at least 60% of the frame
