## WHAT CUSTOMERS WANT IMPROVED

### 1. STURDINESS / DURABILITY (Biggest Pain Point)
- **#1 complaint across nearly every product** — 32-34 negative mentions for PREBOX alone
- **Plastic looms break** during first use or when removing finished projects
- Pegs pull out of holes under tension
- Frame disconnects mid-project
- Heart-shaped/decorative pieces pop off
- *"Flimsy plastic... breaks during first use"*
- *"Pegs keep falling out and the frame disconnects in the middle of a project"*
- **Recommendation from reviewers:** "Buy a kit with a **metal frame** to avoid this"

### 2. Instructions Quality (Major Gap)
- Instructions are **unclear, incomplete, or too complex** for the target age
- Kids can't follow them independently despite marketing claims
- Particularly bad for finishing/removing projects from loom
- Better to watch YouTube videos than follow included instructions
- National Geographic specifically criticized: *"Instructions are not very clear at all... tears and lots of help from me"*
- **Opportunity:** Video tutorials (QR codes) would solve this

### 3. Value for Money
- 12-16 negative mentions across top products
- Products that cost $30-40 feel **cheap for the price**
- Plastic materials don't justify premium pricing
- *"$50. I was disappointed. To me it looked like a present I would pay $20-25"*
- Customers expect higher quality at the $30+ price point

### 4. Loop Quality & Quantity
- Some loops are too stretchy (hard to maintain tension)
- Some loops are not stretchy enough (hard to get on loom)
- Cotton loops preferred over acrylic for durability of finished product
- Customers often need to buy **refill loops** — not enough for extended play
- Inconsistent quality between production batches

### 5. Loom Size Limitations
- Small looms (7") limit project variety
- Customers want **larger sizes** for more creative projects
- Only small potholders/coasters possible with standard 7" frames

### 6. Needle/Tool Quality
- Wooden needles break (National Geographic)
- Crochet hooks too small or uncomfortable
- Finishing tool could be more kid-friendly

## KEY MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

### 1. **Build a STURDY loom** (Metal or high-quality wood)
The single biggest gap in this market. Every plastic loom gets destroyed. Customers literally say "buy a kit with a metal frame." A **metal or premium wood frame** would be a major differentiator.

### 2. **Better instructions + Video tutorials**
Include QR codes linking to step-by-step video tutorials. Instructions should work for the actual target age (6-8), not just adults. This is the second biggest complaint.

### 3. **Price the quality right**
Don't charge $35+ for a plastic loom with cheap loops. Either offer premium quality at premium prices, or provide great value at $15-20. The "expensive but cheap-feeling" gap is frustrating customers.

### 4. **Include enough loops for extended play**
Parents buy refills immediately. Including 300-400+ loops or making refills easy to purchase increases lifetime value and satisfaction.

### 5. **Hooks/grips on pegs**
The PREBOX feature where pegs have small hooks to prevent loops from slipping was the single most praised design feature. *"That little feature ALONE makes this worth paying a little extra."*

### 6. **Storage solution included**
Kits with organized storage boxes get significantly better reviews. Portability is a key buying factor.

### 7. **Multi-project versatility**
Show customers how to make more than potholders — bags, bracelets, coasters, wall art. This extends the perceived value dramatically.

## BOTTOM LINE FOR CRAFTILOO

The market is dominated by **cheap plastic looms** that break and frustrate customers. The opportunity is clear:

1. **A sturdy metal or premium wood loom** would instantly differentiate
2. **Clear, kid-friendly instructions with video support** would address the #2 complaint
3. **Quality cotton loops in vibrant colors** with generous quantity would delight
4. **Anti-slip peg design** (hooks on pegs) is a proven crowd-pleaser
5. **Storage box included** is expected at the $25+ price point
6. **Target the gift market** — packaging, presentation, and "giftability" matter enormously
