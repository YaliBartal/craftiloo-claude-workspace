## STRATEGIC NOTES

### Category Placement Recommendation
**List in Toys & Games > Arts & Crafts > Craft Kits > Sewing** rather than Arts, Crafts & Sewing > Cross-Stitch.
- EZCRA sells 600+/month from the Toys category
- Craftiloo sells 100+/month from the Arts & Crafts category
- Toys category captures gift buyers and toy shoppers, not just craft enthusiasts
- Barbie is a toy brand — parents expect to find it in Toys

### Price Recommendation
**$17.99-$19.99** — Matches EZCRA/Pllieay range. Barbie licensing justifies parity pricing. Going above $21.98 is risky without review social proof. Starting at $17.99 with 7 Barbie designs + threaders offers the strongest value proposition in the category.

### Competitive Advantages (Summary)
1. **Only licensed cross stitch kit on Amazon** — zero direct competition
2. **2 threaders** — solves the #1 customer complaint across all competitors
3. **7 keychains in Barbie colors** — most functional output of any kit
4. **4 plastic needles** — more than EZCRA (1) and Craftiloo (2)
5. **Barbie sticker page** — bonus value beyond stitching
6. **No hoops** — eliminates broken hoop and stiff fabric complaints entirely
