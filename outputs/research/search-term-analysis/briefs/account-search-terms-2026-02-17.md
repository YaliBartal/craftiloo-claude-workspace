- [ ] **No Portfolio campaigns:** 78% ACoS, 96% wasted. Assign to portfolios or pause.
- [ ] **Fuse beads cannibalization:** Same keywords in broad AND exact AND TOS campaigns — consolidate targeting.
- [ ] **Fairy family broad leakage:** "kids sewing kits age 5-8" in both exact ($98.60, 49.6% ACoS) and phrase ($49.48, 123.8% ACoS). Negate in broad/phrase.
- [ ] **New opportunity: "crochet for kids"** — 2 orders at 2% ACoS from Catch All. Not in any manual campaign. Worth testing.

### Track Next Week
- [ ] Re-run search term analysis with fresh data to validate negations worked
