**Account-Level Assessment:**
The account is performing at **33.5% ACoS** with **8.16% CVR**, which is slightly above the ideal 30% ACoS target and below the 10% CVR target. The account generated $15,719 in sales from $5,266 spend. Several portfolios are exceeding healthy ACoS thresholds (4 Flowers embroidery at 67.9%, princess lacing cards at 53.8%), indicating immediate optimization needed. Catch-All and Shield portfolios are performing well. The account has $516.98 in immediately recoverable spend from P1 negations.

### Red Flag Check (per SOP Section 16.3)

| Red Flag | Current Status |
|----------|---------------|
| CVR < 5% (any portfolio) | **4 Flowers embroidery: 4.4% CVR** |
| ACoS > 50% for 7+ days (any portfolio) | **4 Flowers embroidery: 67.9%**, **princess lacing cards: 53.8%**, **Cross And Embroidery Kits: 53.1%** |
| Hero keywords dropping (requires Data Dive) | Flag for Data Dive review |
| No new test campaigns in last 2 weeks | Multiple LOW BID test campaigns active (within evaluation period) |

**Note on TACoS:** Total ACoS (ad spend / total revenue including organic) is a key monthly KPI per SOP but cannot be calculated from PPC reports alone — requires Sellerboard data. Track separately.
