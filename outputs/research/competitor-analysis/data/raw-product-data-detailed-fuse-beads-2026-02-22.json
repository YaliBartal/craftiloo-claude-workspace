    "top_review": "This fuse bead kit is awesome! I got this kit as a shared Christmas gift for my 7 and 10 year old. They both have used kits like this at afterschool programs and at friends’ houses, but were really pumped to have their own set.The colors are vibrant and there are so many in the kit the kids will be able to make a ton of things. I also like that there are multiple pegboards with so many templates to choose from to have a guide on making things, but of course the kids can use their imagination to craft whatever they want.The case is prefect, keeping the colors separated, and making it easy to store or travel with. This craft kit is worth it!",

    "top_review": "Love it! Accidentally bought the minis instead of the regular size but that was a blessing in disguise as it had the exact dark green I needed to make my projects! So the variety is awesome. The board warps slightly when ironing but it’s still very usable afterwards. All my projects came out beautifully and they definitely are made to last.I really hope the seller makes it available to purchase one color of beads as I’m running out of black, white and dark green!Awesome product though, it’s truly helped put my hopes and dreams into reality, don’t think twice and buy it! Not only is it fun to do, but it’s awesome for concentration since the beads are so small and intricate. That said, definitely don’t buy the mini beads for kids😂 they might eat them.",
