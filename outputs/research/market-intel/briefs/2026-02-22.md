## Data Notes

- **BSR:** All 13 hero + 8 competitor products fully scraped. Accurate.
- **Keywords:** Scraper returned only 5 items/run today. Issue is unexplained — likely scraper tier/config change. Consider using `maxPages: 3` or a different scraper for future runs to get deeper results.
- **CYANFOUR review velocity:** +41 reviews in 24h is extremely high — watch for any price changes or promotions
- **Creativity for Kids BSR:** Consistently unavailable from scraper. Likely a listing configuration issue.
- **Fairy Sewing reviews (608 vs 621):** Minor scraper variance — not a real drop
