It’s pretty easy for her to use but she was getting frustrated trying to figure out how to follow instructions so I don’t know how realistic it is for beginners to do it correctly, but it’s a great learning process.",

      "review_comment": "I got this for my preschooler who loves watching me learn to do embroidery and wanted to make something himself. With a little assistance in threading the needle and making sure he follows the pattern, he has been able to do them himself. The animals are organized from the most basic pattern to the most difficult, which is very helpful. The first two patterns have a very clear guide on how to do the stitches, which are just straight lines of X’s. The annoying part is that when you progress to the more difficult patterns of making shapes and turning corners, there is almost no direction. They show you the picture of which color goes where, but offer no guidance on how best to make that shape. Also worth noting, they tell you how long to cut the yarn for the first two patterns, but there’s no length guidelines on the subsequent patterns, so make sure to count the additional stitches and adjust length accordingly. Yarn quality is great, and my son very much enjoys making them and showing his family what he has made. If you have a background in cross stitch, you’ll likely not be as frustrated as I was. An update in instruction quality or accompanying YouTube tutorials would make this an easy 5 stars.",

      "review_comment": "This is a wonderful kit. I had no idea how much fun it would be. It comes with everything you need to complete the 4-inch squares. The yarn is great you get enough to finish all of the pretty squares..They test them by finishing all of the squares to see how much yarn they need. The little squares are cute and fun. It's a great way to spend some spare time, relax, and get something as a reward. You won't be sorry, this company makes several kits like this. I have all of them and they are just the neatest little things. They're not for a child. They supply plastic needles that don't work, you have to have your own tapestry needle. The intimate that this kit is for a child, but I don't think a little young lady could do the cross stitch on these. After I bought my first one I bought three others. You won't be sorry. They are quality, fun, and really cute.",

      "review_comment": "Not necessarily for 'beginners' - Pros: Product is cute, yarn is soft, needles are pliable plastic (expectedly), designs are cute and the package came with everything it listed. (In response to other negative reviews, you aren't meant to yank or over tighten thread or needles, the breakage I feel is a user issue as opposed to the product) Cons: Pattern doesn't make sense in regards to cross stitching when its slapped on the template the way it is. For example, the octopus - (see photo) - the portion in the center of the template cannot be replicated on an odd number of squares. Colors are difficult to differentiate between, makes it confusing as to which version of orange/blue etc should be used, even with the photo. Yarn is so fluffy that it creates a messy look if not done correctly/with correct tension Recommendations: Denser yarn, better/more realistic example photos (and larger so they're visible), labeled yarn skeins, differently formatted patterns (see photo) This is only 'beginner friendly in the sense that it's \"simple designs\" on a plastic board with chunky yarn - the actual process of making it work however requires atleast some experience -- definitely not for most kids. The dinosaur cross stitch I've included (from Dollar tree) shows a good example of an easy to follow pattern as well as a good plastic needle that can pinch your yarn. The needles in the bag are what comes with this product.",

Also, the booklet says that the threads are made from 100% cotton and that is clearly not true. They are definitely synthetic and poor quality. Why lie?",

Everything she needs is in this kit including printed patterns, beautiful colors of thread, needle and a hoop for each project. Every pattern is small and able to be accomplished easily. Plus the pattern is printed in color to show her where to begin and how to proceed. These small projects will teach basics....then we will gradually introduce more challenging projects. I am very impressed by the quality and the price. I have shared my love of cross stitch with my five granddaughters and I hope to pass on my love of counted cross stitch to my greatgranddaughter.",

      "review_comment": "I am an experienced needleworker who purchased this kit for my 9-year-old granddaughter. She enjoys crafts and I wanted to introduce her to an easy form of needlework. The kit has cute and easily- manageable designs and is decent quality for a beginner's set. It includes cotton floss, needles, needle threaders, nice hoops, key chains and fabric that is stamped with the various designs. The fabric is very stiff and difficult to evenly place in the hoops. The accompanying instructions are very good at describing how to do cross stitch. However, the instructions do not include how to attach the provided keychains to convert the finished cross-stitch hoops to the advertised backpack charms nor how to trim the excess fabric. These last 2 steps are not easy to do and children will definitely need help with them. Personally, I would find other ways to display the completed hoops since they won't last very long as backpack charms. That is exactly what we did - we hung a completed one on my granddaughter's desk and it looks really cute. This is a nice kit for a beginning cross stitch project, but I wouldn't count on it as a backpack charm.",

However, the instructions are pretty bare bones and kind of hard to understand for a beginner. It would be nice if there was a QR code or a way to watch a video tutorial. The yarn is pretty low quality and frayed easily. The size of the project is nice and manageable. It is also nice how the project is printed in color on the material.",

They are basic and small patterns, but worked really well for a beginner. It's a good value for what you get and you won't have an over investment if the beginner decides it's not an activity they want to continue doing.",

He loves them simple, quick patterns so he never gets bored of using the same color and pattern all the time. So far, he’s done too, and he’s not slowing down! if your kid likes slime or any kind of tactile activity, they’ll like cross stitching. I’m so glad things like this still exist.
