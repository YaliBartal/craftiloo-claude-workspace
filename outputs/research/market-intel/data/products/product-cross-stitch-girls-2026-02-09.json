Everything she needs is in this kit including printed patterns, beautiful colors of thread, needle and a hoop for each project. Every pattern is small and able to be accomplished easily. Plus the pattern is printed in color to show her where to begin and how to proceed. These small projects will teach basics....then we will gradually introduce more challenging projects. I am very impressed by the quality and the price. I have shared my love of cross stitch with my five granddaughters and I hope to pass on my love of counted cross stitch to my greatgranddaughter.",

      "review_comment": "I am an experienced needleworker who purchased this kit for my 9-year-old granddaughter. She enjoys crafts and I wanted to introduce her to an easy form of needlework. The kit has cute and easily- manageable designs and is decent quality for a beginner's set. It includes cotton floss, needles, needle threaders, nice hoops, key chains and fabric that is stamped with the various designs. The fabric is very stiff and difficult to evenly place in the hoops. The accompanying instructions are very good at describing how to do cross stitch. However, the instructions do not include how to attach the provided keychains to convert the finished cross-stitch hoops to the advertised backpack charms nor how to trim the excess fabric. These last 2 steps are not easy to do and children will definitely need help with them. Personally, I would find other ways to display the completed hoops since they won't last very long as backpack charms. That is exactly what we did - we hung a completed one on my granddaughter's desk and it looks really cute. This is a nice kit for a beginning cross stitch project, but I wouldn't count on it as a backpack charm.",

The yarn is pretty low quality and frayed easily. The size of the project is nice and manageable. It is also nice how the project is printed in color on the material.",
