## Detailed Competitor Comparison

### Competitor 1: EZCRA (Search Position #2)

**ASIN:** [B0DFHN42QB](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFHN42QB)
**Product:** EZCRA Beginner Needlepoint Cross Stitch Kit for Kids Ages 5-8

| Metric | EZCRA | CRAFTILOO | Winner |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **BSR** | #14,955 (Toys & Games) | **#4,222** (Arts, Crafts) | **CRAFTILOO (71% better)** |
| **Category Rank** | #14 Kids' Sewing Kits | **#3 Cross-Stitch** | **CRAFTILOO** |
| **Price** | $17.99 | $19.98 | EZCRA ($2 cheaper) |
| **Rating** | 4.6★ | 4.5★ | EZCRA (0.1★ higher) |
| **Reviews** | 165 | **1,278** | **CRAFTILOO (675% more)** |
| **Search Position** | #2 | **#1** | **CRAFTILOO** |

**EZCRA Analysis:**
- **Newer product** - Only 165 reviews vs our 1,278
- **Budget positioning** - $17.99 vs our $19.98
- **Different category** - Positioned in "Kids' Sewing Kits" not Cross-Stitch (category confusion?)
- **Weaker BSR** - #14,955 is significantly worse than our #4,222
- **Recent launch momentum** - Reviews dated Jan-Feb 2026 (very new)

**Threats:**
- ✅ Minimal - New product still building traction
- Lower price may attract budget shoppers
- Good rating (4.6★) could convert well

**Opportunities:**
- They're miscategorized (Sewing vs Cross-Stitch) - we're in correct category
- Our massive review advantage (1,278 vs 165) = stronger social proof
- Our BSR is 3.5x better

### Competitor 2: Pllieay (Search Position #3)

**ASIN:** [B0CG9FN2CH](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CG9FN2CH)
**Product:** Pllieay 10-in-1 Cross Stitch Beginner Kit for Kids

| Metric | Pllieay | CRAFTILOO | Winner |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| **BSR** | #17,071 (Arts, Crafts) | **#4,222** (Arts, Crafts) | **CRAFTILOO (75% better)** |
| **Category Rank** | #65 Embroidery Kits | **#3 Cross-Stitch** | **CRAFTILOO** |
| **Price** | $19.99 | $19.98 | Tie (identical) |
| **Search Position** | #3 | **#1** | **CRAFTILOO** |

**Pllieay Analysis:**
- **Direct price competitor** - Both at ~$20 price point
- **Different category positioning** - They're in Embroidery (#65), we're in Cross-Stitch (#3)
- **Weaker BSR** - #17,071 is 4x worse than our #4,222
- **Known brand from competitors.md** - Listed as #2 competitor with 18% market share estimate

**From Competitors.MD Context:**
- Pllieay = #2 competitor in Cross Stitch category
- Est. market share: 18% (vs our 22%)
- Known for: "10-in-1 beginner kits, high volume, ages 7-13"
- Price positioning: Budget ($8-15) - **BUT this product is $19.99, not budget tier!**

**Key Finding:** Pllieay is moving upmarket with this $19.99 product (vs their typical $8-15 range). This suggests:
1. They're testing premium pricing
2. Competing directly with us on value proposition
3. May indicate market shift toward higher-price, higher-value kits

**Threats:**
- ⚠️ Medium - Direct price competitor from established brand
- They have brand recognition in the space
- 10-in-1 positioning (vs our 5 projects) could be perceived as better value

**Opportunities:**

- Our category rank is superior (#3 vs #65)
- Our search position is higher (#1 vs #3)
