## Recommendations

### 🎯 Immediate Actions

2. **Monitor stockouts** - BSR spike + stockout = lost momentum
3. **Analyze traffic source** - What drove this spike? (ads, social, seasonal, keyword rank?)
4. **Increase PPC if running** - Ride the momentum with more traffic
5. **Check Buy Box** - Ensure you're maintaining Buy Box at current price

### 📈 Strategic Opportunities
1. **Bundle opportunity** - Cross-promote with other craft kits showing momentum
2. **Review generation** - Launch campaign to get more reviews while sales are high
3. **Content refresh** - Update A+ content or listing while visibility is high
4. **Competitor analysis** - Study the #1 and #2 Cross-Stitch kits to find gaps

### ⚠️ Watch For
1. **Sustainability** - Is this a one-day spike or new baseline?
2. **Competition response** - Will competitors drop prices to regain position?
3. **Stockout risk** - Accelerated sales can surprise inventory planning
