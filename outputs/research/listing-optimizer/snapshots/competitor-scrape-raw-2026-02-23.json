The yarn or whatever it\u2019s called is pretty solid, seems to hold up well. It\u2019s pretty easy for her to use but she was getting frustrated trying to figure out how to follow instructions so I don\u2019t know how realistic it is for beginners to do it correctly, but it\u2019s a great learning process.",

        "reviewTitle": "Great kit for kids, but instructions could be better",
        "reviewDescription": "I got this for my preschooler who loves watching me learn to do embroidery and wanted to make something himself. With a little assistance in threading the needle and making sure he follows the pattern, he has been able to do them himself. The animals are organized from the most basic pattern to the most difficult, which is very helpful. The first two patterns have a very clear guide on how to do the stitches, which are just straight lines of X\u2019s. The annoying part is that when you progress to the more difficult patterns of making shapes and turning corners, there is almost no direction. They show you the picture of which color goes where, but offer no guidance on how best to make that shape. Also worth noting, they tell you how long to cut the yarn for the first two patterns, but there\u2019s no length guidelines on the subsequent patterns, so make sure to count the additional stitches and adjust length accordingly. Yarn quality is great, and my son very much enjoys making them and showing his family what he has made. If you have a background in cross stitch, you\u2019ll likely not be as frustrated as I was. An update in instruction quality or accompanying YouTube tutorials would make this an easy 5 stars.",

        "reviewDescription": "Perfect gift for my 8 year old niece that watches me cross stitch and wanted to learn.  The wholes were bigger than typical fabric which made teaching her easier.  The plastic needle is still a little sharp, so I would not use with younger children unless supervised.  There were lots of felt animals for her to practice on.  I wish they would come out with more themes for holidays, etc.",

This kit is a GREAT value. Seriously. I\u2019ve bought stuff from Caydo before and was happy with the products, but my expectations weren\u2019t very high for the price point of this kit. It\u2019s fun and perfect for beginners and advanced stitchers alike! Soooo much better and cheaper than those cheap Bucilla or Dimension kits.They\u2019d also make a great gift-going to grab another to have on hand. All in all I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend this item.",

The kids loved the cute designs. I separated the embroidery thread needed for each design ahead of time, which takes forever but it allowed the students to just sew. The preprinted designs make it so easy for them to see which colors go where.However, the first kit that was sent to me was missing a screw for the hoop (it doesn\u2019t work without it). The replacement set had one of the fabrics sliced across the design. The third one was intact.And although there are enough designs for 5 kids to sew, every single kit only came with 4 needles. Luckily I had an extra.  This is only a problem if you\u2019re using it for 5 kids like I did.",

The colors are so bright and cheerful they made me want to stitch something, and my kids actually sat down quietly to craft.

It\u2019s a fun, easy craft that makes them feel super accomplished, and I love that it keeps them busy doing something creative instead of asking for snacks every five minutes or endless screen time. This is a great value I purchased two other sets.",

There are 7 projects that are scaffolded in a way to teach the skills sequentially. The patterns are clear with pre-punched holes for the thread to go through.
