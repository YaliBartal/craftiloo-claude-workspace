**Start Date:** February 2026 | **Role:** Brand Manager – Product Development & Operations | **Reports to:** CEO/Founder

---

## Welcome to Craftiloo

You're joining a fast-growing, family-owned e-commerce brand founded in 2017. We make sewing kits, craft kits, and creative hobby products — including a currently live Barbie IP licensing line of 8 kits. Our products help kids and families enjoy hands-on creative experiences, and our customers (mostly grandparents and parents buying gifts) love us for the quality and completeness of every kit.

You'll be the person who takes new product ideas all the way from concept to live Amazon listing — and keeps our portfolio growing, profitable, and well-optimized.

---

## Week 1–2: Core Operations Training

These two weeks are about understanding how the business runs before you build on it. By end of Week 2 you should be able to operate all channels independently.

---

### 1. Customer Service & Order Fulfillment

**Goal:** Understand how orders flow from each sales channel through to delivery.

**Channels to walk through:**
- **Amazon** — FBA fulfillment (Amazon ships), MFN/FBM orders if applicable
- **Shopify** — Direct orders, fulfillment workflow
- **Faire** — Wholesale B2B orders via the Faire platform, lead times, minimums
- **Retail (Barnes & Noble)** — EDI or manual order process, routing requirements

**Key things to understand:**
- How each channel sends order notifications
- Who is responsible for each step
- Return and refund handling per channel
- Customer service tone and escalation paths

---

### 2. Shipping & Amazon Fulfillment (FBA)

**Goal:** Understand how Amazon FBA handles fulfillment and what our responsibilities are in the process.

**Topics:**
- How FBA works — inventory stored at Amazon warehouses, Amazon picks/packs/ships
- Creating inbound shipments: shipping plan creation in Seller Central
- Creating shipping labels for inbound shipments to Amazon fulfillment centers
- Box content requirements and compliance
- Receiving discrepancies — what to do when Amazon receives less than what was sent
- Tracking inbound shipments and resolving delays
- How orders on Shopify, Faire, and Barnes & Noble connect to fulfillment

---

### 3. Amazon Reimbursements & Pick & Pack Fees

**Goal:** Understand how to monitor and reclaim money owed by Amazon.

**Reimbursements:**
- What triggers a reimbursement (lost/damaged inventory, FBA errors)
- How to identify discrepancies using Seller Central reports
- Reimbursements are handled by our third-party **Sellers Investigators** service — your role is to pull and provide the required documents to them
- Using Seller Board for profit reconciliation

**Pick & Pack / FBA Fees:**
- Understand FBA fee structure (pick & pack, storage, referral)
- How to identify fee anomalies
- Strategies to reduce fees (product dimensions, weight optimization, removal orders)
- Where to find fee breakdowns per ASIN in Seller Central and Seller Board

---

### 4. Product Development Process & Image Creation

**Goal:** End-to-end understanding of how we bring a new product to market.

**The Product Development Flow:**
1. Market & competitor research → validate opportunity
2. Define kit components, materials, and sourcing specs
3. Submit concept for approval (Mattel licensing step if branded)
4. Brief designers for packaging, instructions, and product graphics
5. Source manufacturer → samples → QA/factory audit
6. Finalize specs, create listing copy (title, bullets, description, A+ content)
7. Shoot or generate listing images
8. Launch → monitor rankings, velocity, PPC

**Image Creation:**
- **Lifestyle images** — What makes a good lifestyle image for our audience (gifting context, kids/grandparents, in-use shots)
- **Product images** — White background, compliance specs, dimension callouts
- **A+ content** — Layout, comparison modules, brand story blocks
- Canva for design work
- AI image generation with **Love Art** (see dedicated section below)

---

### 5. AI Image Generation with Love Art

**Goal:** Independently create product and lifestyle images using Love Art AI.

**Training will cover:**
- Account setup and workspace navigation
- Prompt writing for craft kit lifestyle images (kids crafting, gift scenarios, in-use shots)
- Style consistency — maintaining brand look across images
- Iteration — how to refine outputs
- When to use AI vs. when to brief a human designer
- Saving, naming, and organizing outputs in Google Drive per our file standards

## Key Context: Our Products

**Craftiloo (Main Brand)** — Sewing kits: cross stitch, embroidery, latch hook, punch needle, needlepoint
- Target buyer: Grandparents and parents buying gifts for girls aged 6–12
- **Active Barbie licensing** — 8 kits currently shipping to Amazon, 4 more in development

**Shinshin Creations** — Fuse beads targeted at adult hobbyists (2.2mm beads)

**Design principles:** Complete kits with everything included, pre-cut/pre-stamped fabrics, safe and high-quality materials.

---

## Licensing & Compliance (Critical)

- We hold a **Mattel/Barbie IP license** — all Barbie-branded products require concept approval before production
- All listings must comply with Amazon policies (categories, safety claims, age grading)
- Any new Barbie kit must go through the licensing approval workflow before supplier briefing
- When in doubt on compliance → escalate to the founder before acting

---

## 2026 Strategic Priorities (Your Work Feeds Into These)

- Launch 8 Barbie kits + develop 4 more
- Develop ~4 new non-branded craft kits
- Expand to retail: Target.com, Walmart.com, Michaels, Hobby Lobby, Bed Bath & Beyond
- Improve overall brand identity and Amazon storefront
- Build scalable systems for product development and performance tracking

---

## Notes for Pamela

- **Documentation first** — Notion is the source of truth. Every process has an SOP. Read it before asking.
- **Improve the docs as you go** — If you find a process that's missing, incomplete, or unclear in Notion, document it. Don't leave gaps. A well-documented process you learned today saves the whole team time tomorrow.
- **Asana is non-negotiable** — Every task gets logged, assigned, and tracked. This is how we stay aligned as a remote team.
- **Quality standards are non-negotiable** — We never compromise on materials or safety. If something feels off, flag it.
- **Proactive > reactive** — Spot a fee anomaly, a rank drop, or a conversion issue before it becomes a problem. That's the job.
- **You have latitude** — Once you understand how we operate, you're empowered to make product decisions. Use the data.
