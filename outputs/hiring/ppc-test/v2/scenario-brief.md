# ArtKraft — PPC Specialist Practical Assessment

**What this is:** A practical exercise designed to mirror the actual work you'd do in this role. There is no exam format, no trick questions, and no time pressure. We want to see how you think and how you work — not how fast you type.

---

## Context

ArtKraft is a kids arts & crafts brand on Amazon US. We sell across multiple craft categories — sewing kits, fuse beads, cross stitch, latch hook, embroidery, knitting, and more.

You've just been onboarded. It's Monday morning. We've pulled the most recent week of data and exported it in the same format we work with daily. Your job is to dig in and tell us what you see.

## Your Tasks

### Step 1 — Account Overview (start here)

Open `account-overview-Feb2026.xlsx`.

Look at the account-level KPIs at the top and the portfolio breakdown below. Get oriented. Then answer:

1. What is the overall health of this account based on what you see?
2. Which portfolios stand out to you — positively or negatively — and why?
3. What would be your first priority if you were taking over this account today?

Write your answers in plain language. 3–5 sentences per question is enough.

### Step 2 — Scenario A: The Rank Emergency

Open `scenario-1-fuse-beads.xlsx`.

This is our Fuse Beads portfolio. It has 4 tabs — start with Campaigns, then check the Rank Tracker tab.

**The situation:** A product in this portfolio is showing a drop in organic rank on several of its most important keywords over the past 10 days.

Your task:
1. Find the rank drop in the Rank Tracker. Which keywords are affected and how severe is it?
2. Look at the campaign data. Is the current PPC setup helping or hurting the organic rank situation?
3. What specific changes would you make to the campaigns this week to address it? Be specific — which campaigns, which settings, what actions.

### Step 3 — Scenario B: The Optimization Round

Open `scenario-2-knitting.xlsx`.

This is our Kids Knitting portfolio. It's a newer product, roughly 4 months old.

**The situation:** The portfolio is spending but performance is mixed. Your goal is to tighten it up — reduce wasted spend and find efficiency — without killing any momentum the product has built.

Your task:
1. Review the Campaigns tab. Which campaigns are worth investing in and which are bleeding spend?
2. Review the Search Terms tab. Find at least 3 search terms you'd act on — whether that's negating, graduating to exact match, or adjusting bid. Explain each.
3. What is your overall optimization plan for this portfolio over the next 2 weeks?

---

### Step 4 — Scenario C: The Structure Question

Open `scenario-3-catch-all.xlsx`.

This is our Catch All Auto portfolio. It runs across all products in the account.

**The situation:** You're looking at this for the first time. There are 6 auto campaigns all doing roughly the same thing — running across the catalogue — but at different bid levels.

Your task:
1. What do you think this structure is designed to do? Does it make sense to you?
2. Would you keep it as-is, modify it, or replace it with something different?
3. What would you change about how we're managing it right now, if anything?

### Step 5 — Scenario D: The Broken Portfolio

Open `scenario-4-four-flowers.xlsx`. Start with the **Context tab** to understand the product, then work through Campaigns, Search Terms, and Placements.

This is our 4 Flowers Adult Embroidery portfolio. It's been live for about 4 months. The manager's note on the Context tab says it all — we're spending almost as much as we're making and we can't figure out why.

Your task:
1. Diagnose what's wrong. Why is this portfolio stuck at ~85% ACOS despite 4 months of running?
2. Identify the specific campaigns, search terms, or settings that are causing the most damage. Be precise.
3. Build a 2-week recovery plan. What do you fix first, what do you fix second, and what's your target ACOS at the end of 2 weeks?

## Submission

Send back a single document (Google Doc, Word, or PDF) with your answers to all 4 steps. Label each section clearly (Step 1, Scenario A, etc.).

There's no right length — write as much or as little as you need to clearly communicate your thinking. We care more about the reasoning behind your decisions than the decisions themselves.
