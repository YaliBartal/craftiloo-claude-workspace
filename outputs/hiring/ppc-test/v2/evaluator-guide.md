# Evaluator Guide — PPC Assessment

## What You're Evaluating

Not just PPC knowledge — **judgment**. The data has been deliberately chosen to have nuance. The right answer is almost never the obvious one. You want to see:

- Does he look at TACoS, or panic about ACOS?
- Does he ask "what's the context?" before making decisions?
- Does he understand how PPC affects organic rank?
- Can he tell the difference between a broken campaign and a strategic one?

## Step 1 — Account Overview

**What a strong answer looks like:**

- Notices TACoS (18%) is healthy despite PPC ACOS looking high (56.5%)
- Understands that 68% organic / 32% PPC split means PPC is supporting organic — not carrying the account
- Notes YoY improvement: sales up 43%, TACoS *down* from 20% to 18% — the brand is scaling profitably
- Calls out high-ACOS portfolios but *qualifies* them ("this might be a launch product")
- First priority is something specific — not "improve ACOS across the board"

**Red flags:**
- "ACOS of 56% is way too high — need to cut spend" — misses the TACoS picture entirely
- Lists every portfolio as a problem with no prioritization
- First priority is generic ("I'd do a full audit")

## Step 2 — Scenario A: Fuse Beads / Rank Emergency

**The core trap:** "fuse beads" dropped from rank 3–4 to rank 9–10 over 10 days (28,964 monthly searches). This is a meaningful decline on a high-volume keyword.

**The wrong instinct:** Cut PPC spend because ACOS is high. This makes the rank drop worse.

**What a strong answer looks like:**

| Question | Strong answer |
|----------|--------------|
| Rank drop | Identifies "fuse beads" (rank 3→10) and "perler beads" (rank 6→10) as the critical ones. Notes "mini perler beads" is locked at rank 1 — no urgency there. |
| PPC setup | Connects the rank drop to insufficient TOS coverage on those specific keywords. Notes the current spend may not be enough to hold top positions. |
| Specific changes | Increases TOS exact match bids on "fuse beads" and "perler beads". Considers reallocating some budget from "mini perler beads" (already dominant) to the declining keywords. Sets a monitoring cadence. |

**What a weak answer looks like:**
- Notes the rank drop but doesn't connect it to the PPC data
- Recommends reducing broad spend without increasing exact match TOS spend
- Suggests pausing campaigns because ACOS looks high

**The deepest insight (senior hire signal):** Asks whether something else caused the drop — listing change, stock issue, competitor deal — before assuming it's purely a PPC problem. Proposes investigating before acting.

## Step 3 — Scenario B: Kids Knitting / Optimization

**Context to keep in mind:** This product is ~4 months old. High ACOS is normal at this stage. The goal is efficiency improvement, not perfection.

**What a strong answer looks like:**

| Question | Strong answer |
|----------|--------------|
| Campaign quality | Identifies the loom knitting TOS campaign (138% ACOS, $67.93 spend) as the worst performer — but asks "is this a ranking push?" before recommending pause. Identifies campaigns with zero sales and low impressions as low-risk pauses. |
| Search term actions | Finds irrelevant search terms to negate. Finds 2–3 high-converting terms in broad/auto to graduate to exact match. Specifies match type for negatives (exact vs phrase). |
| 2-week plan | Phased: week 1 = negatives and bid adjustments. Week 2 = reassess after changes, graduate any new winners from auto. Doesn't try to fix everything at once. |

**Red flags:**
- Recommends pausing all campaigns above 50% ACOS (includes too many strategic campaigns)
- Negates root keywords that would block good traffic ("knitting", "kit for kids")
- No mention of product age context — treats it like a mature product

---

## Step 4 — Scenario C: Catch All Structure

**What the structure is:** A tiered keyword discovery engine. Each bid tier captures traffic at a different price point:
- 0.15 / 0.19 = very low-cost discovery, finds efficient long-tail terms
- 0.29 = mid-range, catches most keyword categories
- 0.39 = higher-intent terms, slightly higher bid to compete
- 0.49 = competitive terms, willing to pay more for the click

Terms that convert in each tier get graduated to manual campaigns with targeted bids. The auto tiers keep running to surface new keywords continuously.

**What a strong answer looks like:**
- Understands the tiered structure is intentional keyword discovery, not disorganization
- Would keep the structure but review which tiers are actually graduating keywords
- Suggests auditing search terms *per tier* — terms that convert in the 0.19 tier should be moved to exact match and negated in the auto campaigns
- Notes that the 0.39 tier has high ACOS (49%) — worth investigating whether it's finding unique keywords not captured by other tiers, or just duplicating spend

**What a weak answer looks like:**
- "I'd consolidate to one auto campaign to keep it simple"
- "I'd pause the high-ACOS tiers (0.39, 0.49)"
- Doesn't understand why there are multiple tiers at different bid levels

**The trap:** The 0.39 tier's 49% ACOS looks bad — but if it's discovering keyword categories that the lower tiers miss, cutting it loses discovery capability. A good candidate asks "what keywords are converting in this tier that aren't converting in the 0.29 tier?" before making a decision.

## Scoring Summary

| Level | What you see |
|-------|-------------|
| **Strong hire** | TACoS-first thinking. Connects rank to PPC strategy. Asks context questions before cutting. Understands the catch-all structure. Has a phased plan, not a blunt one. |
| **Good candidate** | Solid fundamentals. Gets most of the analysis right. May miss the rank/PPC connection or treat launch campaigns like mature ones. Trainable. |
| **Needs development** | Focuses only on ACOS. Recommends blunt cuts. Doesn't ask about product age or context. Treats all high-ACOS campaigns the same. |
| **Not ready** | Recommends cutting the brand defense campaigns. Doesn't notice the rank drop. Generic advice with no data references. |

## Live Follow-Up Questions (for the call)

Use these to dig into weak spots or verify that written answers are genuine:

- *"Walk me through the exact numbers you used to identify the rank drop."*
- *"The loom knitting campaign has 138% ACOS. You said [keep/pause it] — what would change your mind?"*
- *"If the budget for fuse beads was cut by 40% tomorrow, what's the first thing you protect and the first thing you cut?"*
- *"Why do we have 5 catch-all campaigns instead of 1? What would break if we consolidated?"*
- *"TACoS is 18%. Is that good or bad for a brand at our stage? What would you want it to be in 6 months?"*

Any candidate who used AI to write their answers will struggle with these in real-time.
